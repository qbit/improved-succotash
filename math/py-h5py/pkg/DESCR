The h5py package is a Pythonic interface to the HDF5 binary data
format.

It lets you store huge amounts of numerical data, and easily
manipulate that data from NumPy. For example, you can slice into
multi-terabyte datasets stored on disk, as if they were real NumPy
arrays. Thousands of datasets can be stored in a single file,
categorized and tagged however you want.

H5py uses straightforward NumPy and Python metaphors, like dictionary
and NumPy array syntax. For example, you can iterate over datasets
in a file, or check out the .shape or .dtype attributes of datasets.
You don't need to know anything special about HDF5 to get started.

In addition to the easy-to-use high level interface, h5py rests on
a object-oriented Cython wrapping of the HDF5 C API. Almost anything
you can do from C in HDF5, you can do from h5py.

Best of all, the files you create are in a widely-used standard
binary format, which you can exchange with other people, including
those who use programs like IDL and MATLAB.
