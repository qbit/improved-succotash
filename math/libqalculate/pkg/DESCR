Qalculate! is small and simple to use but with much power and
versatility underneath. Features include customizable functions,
units, arbitrary precision, plotting, and a graphical interface
that uses a one-line fault-tolerant expression entry (although it
supports optional traditional buttons).

This package contains the shared library used by all Qalculate!
frontends.
