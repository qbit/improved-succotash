netcdf4-python is a Python interface to the netCDF C library.

netCDF version 4 has many features not found in earlier versions
of the library and is implemented on top of HDF5. This module can
read and write files in both the new netCDF 4 and the old netCDF 3
format, and can create files that are readable by HDF5 clients. The
API is modelled after Scientific.IO.NetCDF, and should be familiar
to users of that module.
