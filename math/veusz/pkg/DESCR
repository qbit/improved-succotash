Veusz is a GUI scientific plotting and graphing package. It is designed
to produce publication-ready Postscript or PDF output. SVG, TIFF, and
bitmap export formats are also supported. Data can be read from text,
CSV, or FITS files, and data can be manipulated or examined from within
the application.

In Veusz, plots are created by building up plotting widgets with a
consistent object-based interface. The program also provides a command
line and scripting interface (based on Python) to its plotting
facilities. It can also act as a Python plotting module.
