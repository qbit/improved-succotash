The ISAAC algorithm is designed to take some seed information and
produce seemingly random results as output.

However, ISAAC (Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add, and Count) has
different goals than other commonly used algorithms. In particular, it's
really fast - on average, it requires only 18.75 machine cycles to
generate a 32-bit value. This makes it suitable for applications where a
significant amount of random data needs to be produced quickly, such
solving using the Monte Carlo method or for games.
