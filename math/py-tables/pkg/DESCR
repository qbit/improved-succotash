PyTables is a package for managing hierarchical datasets and designed
to efficiently and easily cope with extremely large amounts of data.
It s built on top of the HDF5 library, using the Python language
and the NumPy package. It features an object-oriented interface
that, combined with C extensions for the performance-critical parts
of the code (generated using Cython), makes it a fast, yet extremely
easy to use tool for interactively browse, process and search very
large amounts of data. One important feature of PyTables is that
it optimizes memory and disk resources so that data takes much less
space (specially if on-flight compression is used) than other
solutions such as relational or object oriented databases.
