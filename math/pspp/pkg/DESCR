GNU PSPP is a program for statistical analysis of sampled data. It
is a replacement for the proprietary program SPSS, and appears very
similar to it with a few exceptions.

PSPP can perform descriptive statistics, T-tests, anova, linear and
logistic regression, measures of association, cluster analysis,
reliability and factor analysis, non-parametric tests and more. Its
backend is designed to perform its analyses as fast as possible,
regardless of the size of the input data. You can use PSPP with its
graphical interface or the more traditional syntax commands.
