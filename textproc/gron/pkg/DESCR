gron transforms JSON into discrete assignments to make it easier to
grep for what you want and see the absolute 'path' to it. It eases the
exploration of APIs that return large blobs of JSON but have terrible
documentation.

$ gron "https://api.github.com/repos/tomnomnom/gron/commits?per_page=1" | \
    fgrep "commit.author" | grep -v email
json[0].commit.author = {};
json[0].commit.author.date = "2016-07-02T10:51:21Z";
json[0].commit.author.name = "Tom Hudson";

gron can work backwards too, enabling you to turn your filtered data back
into JSON (gron --ungron).
