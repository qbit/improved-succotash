Pandoc is a command-line tool that can convert between numerous
markup and word processing formats, including, but not limited
to, various flavors of Markdown, HTML, LaTeX and Word docx. (See
https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--from for a list of formats).
It can also produce PDF output.

Pandoc's enhanced version of Markdown includes syntax for tables,
definition lists, metadata blocks, footnotes, citations, math, and much
more.

Because pandoc's intermediate representation of a document is less
expressive than many of the formats it converts between, one should
not expect perfect conversions between every format and every other.
Pandoc attempts to preserve the structural elements of a document, but
not formatting details such as margin size. And some document elements,
such as complex tables, may not fit into pandoc's simple document model.
While conversions from pandoc's Markdown to all formats aspire to be
perfect, conversions from formats more expressive than pandoc's Markdown
can be expected to be lossy.
