Code evolves, and we all spend time studying diffs. Delta aims to make this
both efficient and enjoyable: it allows you to make extensive changes to the
layout and styling of diffs, as well as allowing you to stay arbitrarily close
to the default git/diff output.

Delta's main features are:

* Language syntax highlighting with color themes
* Within-line highlights based on a Levenshtein edit inference algorithm
* Git style strings (foreground color, background color, font attributes) are
  supported for >20 stylable elements
* Side-by-side view
* Line numbering
* diff-highlight and diff-so-fancy emulation modes
* Stylable box/line decorations to draw attention to commit, file and hunk
  header sections.
* Support for Git's --color-moved feature.
* Code can be copied directly from the diff (-/+ markers are removed by
  default).
