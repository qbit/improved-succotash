The PRECIS framework makes internationalized user names and passwords safer for
use by applications. PRECIS profiles transform unicode strings into a canonical
form, suitable for comparison.

This Python module implements the PRECIS framework as described in:

- PRECIS Framework: Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison of
  Internationalized Strings in Application Protocols (RFC 8264)

- Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison of Internationalized Strings
  Representing Usernames and Passwords (RFC 8265)

- Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison of Internationalized Strings
  Representing Nicknames (RFC 8266)
