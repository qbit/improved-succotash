lustache is an implementation of the mustache template system in Lua.

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config
files, source code - anything. It works by expanding tags in a template
using values provided in a hash or object.

We call it "logic-less" because there are no if statements, else clauses,
or for loops. Instead there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a
value, some nothing, and others a series of values.
