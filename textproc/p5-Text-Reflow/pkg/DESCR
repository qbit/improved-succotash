These routines will reflow the paragraphs in the given file,
filehandle, string or array using Knuth's paragraphing algorithm (as
used in TeX) to pick "good" places to break the lines.

Each routine takes ascii text data with paragraphs separated by blank
lines and reflows the paragraphs. If two or more lines in a row are
"indented" then they are assumed to be a quoted poem and are passed
through unchanged.

The reflow algorithm tries to keep the lines the same length but also
tries to break at punctuation, and avoid breaking within a proper name
or after certain connectives ("a", "the", etc.). The result is a file
with a more "ragged" right margin than is produced by fmt or
Text::Wrap but it is easier to read since fewer phrases are broken
across line breaks.

This module provides reflow(1), a tool allowing to reflow text straight
from the command line, according to that algorithm.
