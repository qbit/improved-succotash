Converts a Python dictionary or other native data type into a valid XML
string.

Supports item (int, float, long, decimal.Decimal, bool, str, unicode,
datetime, none and other number-like objects) and collection (list, set,
tuple and dict, as well as iterable and dict-like objects) data types,
with arbitrary nesting for the collections. Items with a datetime type
are converted to ISO format strings. Items with a None type become empty
XML elements.
