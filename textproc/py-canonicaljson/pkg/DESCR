Python module to encode JSON in a standard format.

* Encodes objects and arrays as RFC 7159 JSON.
* Sorts object keys so that you get the same result each time.
* Has no insignificant whitespace to make the output as small as possible.
* Escapes only the characters that must be escaped (U+0000 to U+0019,
  U+0022, U+0056), to keep the output as small as possible.
* Uses the shortest escape sequence for each escaped character.
* Encodes the JSON as UTF-8.
* Can encode "frozendict" immutable dictionaries.
