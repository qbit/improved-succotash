Ijson is an iterative JSON parser with standard Python iterator
interfaces. High level interfaces are provided to have ijson yield
native Python objects out of a JSON stream located under a prefix and
to iterate over object members. Some lower level interfaces are also
available. C and pure-Python backends are available.
