Confuse is a configuration library for Python that uses YAML. It takes
care of defaults, overrides, type checking, command-line integration,
human-readable errors, and standard OS-specific locations.

- sensible API resembling dictionary-and-list structures but providing
transparent validation without lots of boilerplate

- combine configuration data from multiple sources

- look for configuration files in platform-specific paths

- integration with command-line arguments via 'argparse'_ or 'optparse'
