XML::TreePP module parses an XML document and expands it to a hash tree
or generates an XML document from a hash tree as the opposite way
around.  This is a pure Perl implementation and requires no modules
depended. This can also fetch and parse an XML document from remote web
server like the XMLHttpRequest object does at JavaScript language.
