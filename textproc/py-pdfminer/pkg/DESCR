PDFMiner is a tool for extracting information from PDF documents. Unlike other
PDF-related tools, it focuses entirely on getting and analyzing text data.
PDFMiner allows one to obtain the exact location of text in a page, as well as
other information such as fonts or lines. It includes a PDF converter that can
transform PDF files into other text formats (such as HTML). It has an
extensible PDF parser that can be used for other purposes than text analysis.

The original pdfminer is no longer actively maintained; this package uses
"pdfminer.six", a community-maintained fork.
