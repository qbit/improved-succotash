"cpandoc" is a perl script that acts like "perldoc" except that if it
would have bailed out with "No documentation found for
"Uninstalled::Module"", it will instead scrape a CPAN index for the
module's documentation.

One important feature of "cpandoc" is that it *only* scrapes the live
index if you do not have the module installed. So if you use "cpandoc"
on a module you already have installed, then it will just read the
already-installed documentation. This means that the version of the
documentation matches up with the version of the code you have. As a
fringe benefit, "cpandoc" will be fast for modules you've installed. :)
