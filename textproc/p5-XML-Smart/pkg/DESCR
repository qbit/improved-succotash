This module provides an easy way to access/create XML data. It's based
on a HASH tree created from the XML data, and enables dynamic access to
it through the standard Perl syntax for Hash and Array, without
necessarily caring about which you are working with. In other words,
each point in the tree works as a Hash and an Array at the same time!
