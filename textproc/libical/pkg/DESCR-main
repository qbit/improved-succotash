Libical is an Open Source implementation of the iCalendar protocols and
protocol data units. The iCalendar specification describes how calendar
clients can communicate with calendar servers so users can store their
calendar data and arrange meetings with other users.

Libical implements RFC2445, RFC2446 and some of RFC2447.
