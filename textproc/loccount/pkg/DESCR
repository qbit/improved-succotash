loccount counts physical source lines of code.

Identifying over 80 languages by file extension and filename pattern, it can
also emit results as self-describing JSON and do COCOMO II as well as COCOMO I
estimates.

loccount is a re-implementation of David A. Wheeler's sloccount tool in Go. Bugs
excepted, the largely unchanged algorithms can be expected to produce identical
output while supporting more languages.
