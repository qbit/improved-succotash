Text::RecordParser reads record-oriented data in a delimited text
file. The most common example have records separated by newlines
and fields separated by commas or tabs, but this module aims to
provide a consistent interface for handling sequential records in
a file however they may be delimited.

This module also includes three tools:

- tab2graph: turn tabular data into a graph (requires p5-GraphViz)
- tablify: turn a delimited text file into a text table (requires
  p5-Text-TabularDisplay)
- tabmerge: unify delimited files on common fields (requires
  p5-Text-TabularDisplay)
