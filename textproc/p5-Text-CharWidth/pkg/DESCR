This module allows determining the display width of strings, mostly
useful with multibyte character encodings. It provides functionality
equivalent to C's wcwidth(3), wcswidth(3) and mblen(3).

While most characters have a width of 1, there are exceptions - many
east Asian characters have a width of 2, and some languages use Unicode
"combining characters" which have a zero width.
