Lunamark is a Lua module for converting Markdown to other textual formats.
Currently HTML, dzslides, Docbook, ConTeXt, LaTeX, and Groff man are the
supported output formats. The markdown parser is written using a PEG
grammar and can also be modified by the user.

The API is described at http://jgm.github.io/lunamark/doc/
