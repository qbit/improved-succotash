The LaTeX::Driver module takes care of running and re-running latex on
a LaTeX document so that forward references, tables of contents, and
lists of figures and tables are resolved.  It will also run bibtex and
makeindex if it detects that a bibliography or in index have been
specified, and will re-run latex again one or more times until the
formatting of the document has stabilized.

The code was in part derived from the Template Toolkit Latex plugin
and patches I had written for Template Toolkit before the Latex plugin
was forked off from the main TT distribution.  It was also inspired by
the latexn C Shell script and the latexmk script by John Collins, both
of which are on CTAN (the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network).
