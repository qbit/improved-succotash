bibtex2html is a collection of tools for translating from BibTeX to
HTML. They allow to produce, from a set of bibliography files in BibTeX
format, a bibliography in HTML format. Here are some features:

- Handle any BibTeX style (even those producing multiple
  bibliographies);
- Use additional fields like abstract, url, ps, etc. to insert web
  links;
- Crossrefs are also replaced by links;
- Sort by dates or authors, in increasing or decreasing order;
- Read simple macros in TeX or LaTeX files;
- Show syntax errors in BibTeX files;
- Extract from one or several BibTeX files the set of entries satisfying
  a given criterion.
