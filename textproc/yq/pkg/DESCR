yq takes YAML input, converts it to JSON, and filters it through jq(1).

No output conversion is done by default.  Command line arguments are forwarded.
yq exits 1 on YAML parsing errors, otherwise jq's exit code is forwarded.

YAML tags in the input are ignored (any nested data is treated as untagged).
Key order is preserved.

xq behaves like yq but takes XML input.  Multiple XML documents can be passed
in separate files/streams.  Entity expansion and DTD resolution is disabled to
avoid XML parsing vulnerabilities.
