Originally published in 1987, Unix Text Processing (UTP) (written by Dale
Dougherty and Tim O'Reilly) provides one of the few comprehensive looks at
all the tools involved in a typical troff-based writing workflow. It covers:

 - UNIX and troff basics
 - text editors (vi, ex, and sed)
 - the ms and mm macro packages
 - scripting with sh, awk, and sed
 - the tbl, eqn and pic preprocessors
 - macro writing 

The appendices provide a collection of reference material and other useful
pointers.
