The GNU Collaborative International Dictionary of English, or GCIDE for
short, is a free dictionary derived from Webster's Revised Unabridged
Dictionary, published 1913, and supplemented with some new definitions,
in particular from WordNet.

The dictionary is created by Patrick J. Cassidy, and proof-read and
supplemented by volunteers from around the world.
