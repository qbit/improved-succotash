Enhancing printing output
=========================
Color printers need color profile files to get better results.  These
files are provided by your printer manufacturer and you have to install
them manually in the correct location.

----------------------------------------------------------------
 NOTE THAT THE LOCATION FOR THE COLOR PROFILE FILES HAS CHANGED
 COMPARED TO SOME EARLIER RELEASES
----------------------------------------------------------------

Early versions of the driver look for color profile files in:
	${TRUEPREFIX}/share/cups/model/<manufacturer>/cms/

This version expects them to be in:
	${TRUEPREFIX}/share/cups/profiles/<manufacturer>/

Where <manufacturer> is samsung, xerox, dell, etc.

If you are updating from a previous release that has profile files in
the old location you must manually relocate them and delete the old
"cms" directory.

To obtain the color profile files download the official Linux drivers 
for your printer and look in the "cms" directory.

Samsung color profile files are available at
