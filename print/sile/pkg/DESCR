SILE is a typesetting system. Its job is to produce beautiful printed
documents.

SILE takes some textual instructions and turns them into PDF output. It has
features inspired by TeX and InDesign, but seeks to be more flexible,
extensible and programmable than them. It's useful both for typesetting
documents written in the SILE language, and as a processing system for
styling and outputting structured data.
