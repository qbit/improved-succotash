By default, collectd runs as root. Root privileges are required for some
collectd plugins, namely dns and ping plugins.
For more information, please referer to:
${HOMEPAGE}wiki/index.php/Category:Plugins_requiring_privileges

If you do not use these plugins, it is recommended to run collectd daemon
with unpriviliged user account, _collectd. Adjust your configuration with
the following command:

	# rcctl set collectd user "_collectd"

If you had previously run collectd as root using the rrdtool plugin,
you should also change the ownership of /var/collectd to _collectd.

	# chown -R _collectd /var/collectd
