UEFITool is a cross-platform open source application written in C++/Qt, that
parses UEFI-compatible firmware image into a tree structure, verifies image's
integrity and provides a GUI to manipulate image's elements.  Project
development started in the middle of 2013 because of the lack of cross-platform
open source utilities for tinkering with UEFI images.
