| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Utilities
=========

cd_disect       Display SCSI / ATAPI device information
cd_sessions     Optical device sessions report
mmc_format      Format optical media
newfs_udf       Format a filesystem
udfclient       Read or write to a filesystem
udfdump         Display contents of a filesystem

Issuing any command without options will produce a usage summary.

Considerations
==============

Special files and links
-----------------------

* All links will be followed and files replicated when copied to
  a UDF filesystem, whether hard or symbolic links.

* Block, character, FIFO, and socket special files are not
  supported.

UDF on disk drives
------------------

OpenBSD disklabels are not used on storage media.  OpenBSD will create
an in-memory virtual "a" partition when natively mounting UDF filesystems
read-only on 2048-byte block devices or images; see Interoperability with
mount_udf(8) below.

MBRs are not used, the filesystem begins at LBA 0.  Raw partition "c"
should be used if writing directly to a drive instead of an image file.
If the drive contains prior data, zero the leading sectors before use as
shown in the first command below.

# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd9c count=63
# newfs_udf -L shared.drive /dev/rsd9c
# udfclient -W /dev/rsd9c

While it is possible to direct a filesystem image to a disklabel
partition, there would be no interoperability with other OSes.

Interoperability with mount_udf(8)
----------------------------------

Kernel recognition (virtual partition "a") and mounting r/o with
mount_udf() currently requires a 2048-byte logical block size, to
map a filesystem image to an optical drive's sector size.

This precludes direct use with sd(4) devices, and may prevent
interoperability with other OSes.  The OSTA specification
requires a logical blocksize equal to the media sector size, and
the filesystem does not include a Virtual Allocation Table
required for -R media.

If you wish to use mount_udf(), include '-b 2048' with both
the newfs_udf and udfclient utilities.

UDF root directory
------------------

The UDF root directory is named with colon separated strings.

  "<volume set>:<primary volume>:<logical volume>:<additional tag>"

The udfclient requires a 'cd' into this root directory before you can
read or write files and directories. Spaces will require quoting the
string between " " characters.

udfclient interactive commands
------------------------------

These are ftp-like, with some differences.  Use the 'help' command at
the "UDF>" prompt to display a summary.

Of particular value is a 'get' or 'put' of a directory.  This will copy
the entire structure in or out of the filesystem.

$ cd /tmp
$ mkdir test.directory
$ touch test.directory/{a,b,c,d}
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test.iso bs=10m count=10
$ newfs_udf -S test -P test -L test test.iso
$ udfclient -W test.iso
