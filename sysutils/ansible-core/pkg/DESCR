Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles configuration
management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task execution,
network automation, and multi-node orchestration. Ansible makes complex changes
like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy.

ansible-core contains the core engine, modules and plugins. It does not contain
community and partner supported Ansible Collections of modules and plugins.
