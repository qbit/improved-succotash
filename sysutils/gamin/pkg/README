Gamin provides realtime kqueue(2) notifications and monitoring up to the
open file descriptors limit before falling back to polling.
To prevent that, if gamin needs to handle large directories, the
kern.maxfiles sysctl(8) should be increased by adding an entry in
sysctl.conf(5) and the user's login(1) class modified accordingly by
bumping the "cur" and "max" "openfiles" limit in login.conf(5).
