Binwalk is a firmware analysis tool designed to assist in the analysis,
extraction, and reverse engineering of firmware images and other binary
blobs. It is simple to use, fully scriptable, and can be easily extended
via custom signatures, extraction rules, and plugin modules.

Binwalk supports various types of analysis useful for inspecting and
reverse engineering firmware, including:

    Embedded file identification and extraction
    Executable code identification
    Type casting
    Entropy analysis and graphing
    Heuristic data analysis
    "Smart" strings analysis

Binwalk's file signatures are (mostly) compatible with the magic signatures
used by the Unix file utility, and include customized/improved signatures
for files that are commonly found in firmware images such as compressed
files, firmware headers, kernels, bootloaders, filesystems, etc.
