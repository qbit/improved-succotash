symux is a data gatherer for symon, a lightweight system monitor that
measures cpu, memory, interface and disk statistics every 5 seconds and
records the results in RRD files.

A very simple sample perl client is included; the results can also be
graphed via "syweb" (packaged separately) or by any other method that can
work with RRD files.
