SEC is an event correlation tool for advanced event processing which can be
harnessed for event log monitoring, for network and security management, for
fraud detection, and for any other task which involves event correlation. Event
correlation is a procedure where a stream of events is processed, in order to
detect (and act on) certain event groups that occur within predefined time
windows. Unlike many other event correlation products which are heavyweight
solutions, SEC is a lightweight and platform-independent event correlator which
runs as a single process. The user can start it as a daemon, employ it in shell
pipelines, execute it interactively in a terminal, run many SEC processes
simultaneously for different tasks, and use it in a wide variety of other ways.

SEC reads lines from files, named pipes, or standard input, matches the lines
with patterns (like regular expressions or Perl subroutines) for recognizing
input events, and correlates events according to the rules in its configuration
file(s). SEC can produce output by executing external programs (e.g., snmptrap
or mail), by writing to files, by sending data to TCP and UDP based servers, by
calling precompiled Perl subroutines, etc.

Note that the --dumpfjson option requires the presence of the Perl JSON module,
available via the p5-JSON package.
