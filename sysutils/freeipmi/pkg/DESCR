FreeIPMI provides a library and tools to access IPMI Base Management
Controllers, either in-band (host) or out-of-band (LAN etc), based on
the IPMI v1.5/2.0 specification.

In-band requires that kernel ipmi device be enabled. This is present in
standard kernels but not enabled by default, this can be modified with
"boot -c" or config(8). (This can be useful when configuring the local
BMC, e.g. using ipmi-config to adjust or disable network access or
remove vendor default usernames).
