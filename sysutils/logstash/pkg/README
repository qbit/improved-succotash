| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenBSD-specific Limitations
============================
OpenBSD is not on the list of supported platforms:
https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix

Running Logstash
================
Logstash should be started with it's own uid/gid _logstash, since this user
has all necessary filesystem permissions. For example, if you want to check
the configuration, use doas(1):

    # doas -u _logstash ${TRUEPREFIX}/logstash/bin/logstash -t

Or if you want to manage plugins:

    # doas -u _logstash ${TRUEPREFIX}/logstash/bin/logstash-plugin install <plugin>

Upgrading Logstash
==================
Please refer to the upstream documentation when performing upgrades:
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/upgrading-logstash.html
