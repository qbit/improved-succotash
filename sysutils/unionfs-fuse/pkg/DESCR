unionfs-fuse overlays several directory into one single mount point.

It first tries to access the file on the top branch and if the file does
not exist there, it continues on lower level branches. If the user tries
to modify a file on a lower level read-only branch the file is copied to
a higher level read-write branch if the copy-on-write (cow) mode was
enabled.
