By default, Blackbox exporter runs as an unprivileged user. This is
suitable for probing TCP (including HTTP, HTTPS) and DNS endpoints. In
order to probe ICMP endpoints you must run as root - to do this using
the supplied rc.d script you can use the following commands:

    rcctl enable blackbox_exporter
    rcctl set blackbox_exporter user root
