Special notice for APC USB devices
----------------------------------

Some APC USB devices are reported to only work with apcupsd if the
device is attached to ugen(4). Normally these devices attach to upd(4)
to provide system power sensors (see "sysctl hw.sensors"). If you are
having problems using such a device with NUT, you may need to prevent
this attachment.

The option with fewest side-effects is to add the following entries to
the table in /sys/dev/usb/usb_quirks.c and build a new kernel:

{ USB_VENDOR_APC, USB_PRODUCT_APC_UPS, ANY, { UQ_BAD_HID }},
{ USB_VENDOR_APC, USB_PRODUCT_APC_UPS5G, ANY, { UQ_BAD_HID }},

Alternatively, if you do not use a USB keyboard/mouse, you could simply
disable the upd and uhidev drivers. The following line creates a new kernel
with the relevant changes:

  printf 'disable uhidev\ndisable upd\nquit\n' | config -e -o /bsd.no-uhid /bsd
