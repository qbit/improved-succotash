obsdfreqd is a CPU frequency scheduler daemon working in userland.

It has many parameters to tweak the frequency like min/max frequency,
polling frequency, inertia, step up/down size. obsdfreqd also support
limiting the frequency upon reaching a given temperature to avoid
a system spending time above the threshold. While it has many
parameters, the defaults are good enough for everyone.
