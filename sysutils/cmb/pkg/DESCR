cmb is a combinatorics library/utility.

It is both a novel algorithm and the fastest implementation we have for
complex combinatorics. It is faster than python's itertools, faster than
numpy, faster than Perl, faster than Perl XS, faster than comb in R.

It is a port of cmb(1)/cmb(3) from FreeBSD.
