SIMPLE-MTPFS (Simple Media Transfer Protocol FileSystem) is a file system for
Linux capable of operating on files on MTP devices attached via USB to the local
machine. On the local computer where the SIMPLE-MTPFS is mounted, the
implementation makes use of FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace).
The practical effect of this is that the end user can seamlessly interact with
MTP device files.
