Telegraf is an agent for collecting, processing, aggregating, and
writing metrics. Plugin-driven, it has the concept of 4 distinct plugin
types:
* Input Plugins collect metrics from the system, services, or 3rd party
  APIs
* Processor Plugins transform, decorate, and/or filter metrics
* Aggregator Plugins create aggregate metrics (e.g. mean, min, max,
  quantiles, etc.)
* Output Plugins write metrics to various destinations
