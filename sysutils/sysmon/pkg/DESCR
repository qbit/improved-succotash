Sysmon is a network monitoring tool designed to provide high performance
and accurate network monitoring.

This tool is available in the public domain for anyone to use it that is
interested. It provides better performance and checking capabilities than
other tools such as Rover, Nocmon, Whatsup, Big Brother, and other such tools.

Configuration is simple and hierarchical, and can easily integrate email
alerts.  

Currently supported protocols include SMTP, IMAP, HTTP, TCP, UDP, NNTP,
and PING. Sysmon also provides a simple web output of monitored hosts.
