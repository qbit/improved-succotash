Sysmon is a lightweight, customizable and scalable remote monitoring tool that
doesn't require any software installs or changes on the monitored target.

There are two compiled programs that come with sysutils/sysmon: sysmon(1) and
sysmond.

sysmon(1) is a utility that can be run from the shell to check a remote host.
For instance, to check port 80 on the OpenBSD web site:

    $ sysmon http://www.openbsd.org 80

sysmond is the daemon component of the port. It requires a correctly configured
sysmon.conf(5) file, particulary as it is generally setup with hierarchical list
of dependent hosts, normally starting with sysmond's default gateway, i.e., the
"root" knob.

${PREFIX}/share/examples/sysmon/sysmon.conf.dist provides a useful template to
start with. Dispersed infrastructures, clients and staffs can be accomodated.

To understand the syntax for each included check, refer to
${PREFIX}/share/doc/sysmon/config.html.

For instance, one might set the following in sysmond.conf(5), and use the
variables to populate the "contact" setting for particular remote host(s):

        set client0 = "client0@client0.tld";
	set nyc-noc = "nyc-noc@entity.tld";

To further scale sysmon, consider using separate configuration files per entity,
client or other data-normalized category in the main sysmon.conf(5) file:

        include "/etc/sysmon/client0.conf";
	include "/etc/sysmon/nyc-colo.conf";
