Unix's 'time' utility is a simple and often effective way of measuring how
long a command takes to run ('wall time'). Unfortunately, running a command
once can give misleading timings: the process may create a cache on its first
execution, running faster subsequently; other processes may cause the command
to be starved of CPU or IO time; etc. It is common to see people run 'time'
several times and take whichever values they feel most comfortable with.
Inevitably, this causes problems.

multitime is, in essence, a simple extension to time which runs a command
multiple times and prints the timing means, standard deviations, mins,
medians, and maxes having done so. This can give a much better understanding
of the command's performance.
