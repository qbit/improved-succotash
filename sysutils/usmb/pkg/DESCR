usmb lets you mount SMB shares as unprivileged users via FUSE, in the
vein of Windows' Map Network Drive facility. It differs from the other
FUSE SMB filesystems (fusesmb, SMB for FUSE) in that it doesn't have
Network Neighbourhood functionality: this means that you can mount
shares that you can't see via NetBIOS browsing.
