File::Rename is a Perl extension that accepts a list of files, passes
them through a subroutine, and renames them according to the output
of that function.

prename(1) is a command-line tool using this extension, allowing batch
changes like these to be made:

- strip the .bak extension of any *.bak files
prename 's/\.bak$//' *.bak

- translate uppercase names to lower
prename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' *
