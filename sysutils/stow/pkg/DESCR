GNU Stow is a Perl program for managing the installation of software
packages, keeping them separated from each other while making them
appear to be installed in the same place by using symbolic links.

Stow is particularly useful when installing software distributed with
a GNU "configure" script (use the --prefix=path option) or any other
software that installs in a standard hierarchy beneath a configurable
prefix path.

Stow may be used by non-root users to set up a private software
hierarchy under e.g. $HOME/local, or by local administrators who wants
to install software that is not managed by the native package or port
system, and make it available under /opt/local, /sw, or any other
similar location.
