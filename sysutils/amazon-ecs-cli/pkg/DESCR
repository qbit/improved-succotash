The Amazon ECS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a command line interface for
Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) that provides high-level commands to
simplify creating, updating, and monitoring clusters and tasks from a local
development environment. The Amazon ECS CLI supports Docker Compose, a popular
open-source tool for defining and running multi-container applications. Use the
CLI as part of your everyday development and testing cycle as an alternative to
the AWS Management Console.
