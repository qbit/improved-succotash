This package contains the lockfile(1) program, originally distributed
as part of procmail.

lockfile can be used to create one or more semaphore files. If lockfile
can't create all the specified files (in the specified order), it waits
sleeptime (defaults to 8) seconds and retries the last file that didn't
succeed. You can specify the number of retries to do until failure is
returned. If the number of retries is -1 (default, i.e., -r-1) lockfile
will retry forever.
