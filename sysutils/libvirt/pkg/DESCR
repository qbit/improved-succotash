Libvirt is collection of software that provides a convenient way to
manage virtual machines and other virtualization functionality, such as
storage and network interface management. These software pieces include
an API library, a daemon (libvirtd), and a command line utility (virsh).

A primary goal of libvirt is to provide a single way to manage multiple
different virtualization providers/hypervisors. For example, the command
'virsh list --all' can be used to list the existing virtual machines for
any supported hypervisor (KVM, Xen, VMWare ESX, etc.) No need to learn
the hypervisor specific tools!

NOTE that dependency on qemu is not enforced by this package because it brings
lots of dependencies; to manage remote qemu/KVM host, it can be installed with:
    doas pkg_add qemu
