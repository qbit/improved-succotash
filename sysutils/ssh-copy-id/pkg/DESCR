ssh-copy-id is a script that uses ssh(1) to log into a remote machine
(presumably using a login password, so password authentication
should be enabled).

It assembles a list of one or more fingerprints and tries to log
in with each key, to see if any of them are already installed.  It
then assembles a list of those keys that failed to log in, and using
ssh, enables logins with those keys on the remote server. By default
it adds the keys by appending them to the remote user's
~/.ssh/authorized_keys (creating the file, and directory, if
necessary).
