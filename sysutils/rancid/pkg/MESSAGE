If you are upgrading from rancid-<3, please note that router.db field
separator has been changed from ':' to ';' to avoid conflict with IPv6
addresses. Replace the field separator in router.db files before running
rancid.

The configuration files location is changed from ${SYSCONFDIR} to
${SYSCONFDIR}/rancid.
