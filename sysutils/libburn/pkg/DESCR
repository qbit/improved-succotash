libburn is a library by which preformatted data get onto optical media:
CD, DVD, BD (Blu-Ray). On OpenBSD it uses /dev/cdNc.

libburn also offers a facility for reading data blocks from its drives
without using the normal block device i/o, which has its advantages and
disadvantages. It seems appropriate, nevertheless, to do writing and
reading via the same channel.
