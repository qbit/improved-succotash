If no file is provided, the "guest MD" is read from the device file
"/dev/mdesc" which is expected to be present on all sun4v guest domains.

If no file is provided and the -P/--PRI option is used, the PRI
(physical resource inventory) MD is read from the device file
"/devices/pseudo/ds_pri@0:ds_pri" (Solaris only).

The complete PRI is only available on the "primary" domain.
