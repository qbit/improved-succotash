reposync is a script, intended to run from cron, to update an OpenBSD
CVS repository using rsync. To reduce disk io, it only does a full update
if either the ChangeLog has been updated, or some larger time has elapsed
since the last run (to ensure changes with no ChangeLog entry, such as
tagging, are also picked up).
