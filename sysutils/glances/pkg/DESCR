Glances is a cross-platform monitoring tool which aims to present a
maximum of information in a minimum of space through a curses or Web
based interface. It can adapt dynamically the displayed information
depending on the terminal size.

It can also work in client/server mode. Remote monitoring could be
done via terminal, web interface or API (XMLRPC and RESTful).

Glances is written in Python and uses the psutil library to get
information from your system.

Stats can also be exported to external time/value databases.
