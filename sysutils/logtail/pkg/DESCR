logtail displays lines from a standard text file and keeps track of the
offset of the end of the file so that subsequent runs only display new
lines. The file's inode is also recorded so that rotated logs can be
detected.

logtail2 is similar but also uses heuristic plugins so that new lines
in old (uncompressed) log files can also be printed.
