Serf is a decentralized solution for service discovery and orchestration that is
lightweight, highly available, and fault tolerant.

An efficient and lightweight gossip protocol is used to communicate with other
nodes. Serf can detect node failures and notify the rest of the cluster. An
event system is built on top of Serf, letting you use Serf's gossip protocol to
propagate events such as deploys, configuration changes, etc. Serf is completely
masterless with no single point of failure.
