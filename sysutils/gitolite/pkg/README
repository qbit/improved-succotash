Setting up a Git server
=======================
It is advised to use a dedicated 'git' user for use with Gitolite. Now
add this user with adduser(8) and log in as this user.

Access control and repository creation is managed with the
gitolite-admin.git repository. The public SSH key passed to Gitolite
during the initial setup will be the primary access to this
repository. Copy a new or existing key to "key.pub" and run the setup:

  gitolite setup -pk /path/to/key.pub

Now test if everything is setup correctly by running the following
command as the user to whom key.pub belongs:

 git clone git@host:gitolite-admin.git

For further configuration options and learning how to finalize your
setup, please refer to the online Gitolite documentation which is
