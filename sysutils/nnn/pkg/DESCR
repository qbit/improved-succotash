nnn is probably the fastest and most resource-sensitive (with all its
capabilities) file browser you have ever used. It's extremely flexible too -
integrates with your DE and favourite GUI utilities, works with the desktop
opener, supports bookmarks, has smart navigation shortcuts,
navigate-as-you-type mode, disk usage analyzer mode, comprehensive file details
and much more.

Cool things you can do with nnn:

- open any file in the default desktop application or a custom one
- navigate-as-you-type (search-as-you-type enabled even on directory switch)
- check disk usage with number of files in current directory tree
- run desktop search utility (gnome-search-tool or catfish) in any directory
- copy absolute file paths to clipboard, spawn a terminal and use the paths
- navigate instantly using shortcuts like ~, -, & or handy bookmarks
- use cd ..... at chdir prompt to go to a parent directory
- detailed file stats, media info, list and extract archives
- pin a directory you may need to revisit and jump to it anytime
- lock the current terminal after a specified idle time
- change directory on exit
