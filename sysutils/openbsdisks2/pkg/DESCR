A UDisks2 service implementation for OpenBSD forked from FreeBSD
(bsdutils/bsdisks).

OpenBSDisks2 provides a simple DBus org.freedesktop.UDisks2 service.
It only provides readable properties for the UDisks2.Drive,
UDisks2.Block and UDisks2.Filesystem interfaces.

UDisks2 is an abstraction for enumerating disk and storage devices and
performing operations on them.
