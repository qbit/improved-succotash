KTimeTracker helps you track your personal time spent on various
tasks and projects.

It is useful for tracking billable hours and can report the hours
logged by task and day.

With KTimeTracker, you can organize a broken-down project as subtasks
with unlimited nesting. The standard keyboard and mouse shortcuts are
simple and make the tool really comfortable and intuitive to use.
