Gsimplecal is a lightweight calendar applet written in C++ using GTK.

It was originally made for use with tint2 panel in the openbox window
manager (to be launched upon clock click), but of course it works in
any environment (just bind gsimplecal to some hotkey).  For easier
integration, when started it first shows up, when launched again it
closes the running instance (no need to write wrapper scripts or
whatever).

It can be configured to not only show the calendar, but also display
multiple clocks for different world timezones.
