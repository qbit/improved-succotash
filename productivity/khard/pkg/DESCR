Khard is an address book for the console. By itself, it allows creating,
reading, modifying, removing and searching for vCard address book entries
(vcf files) in a directory on your local machine.

Used in conjunction with vdirsyncer, it can be used to access and manage
address books stored on a remote server via CardDAV.

See https://khard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scripting.html#integration
for information about integrating with Mutt etc.
