Kickstart ROM
==============

You will need a Kickstart ROM for the system you wish to emulate.
Kickstart is the name given to the chip in a real Amiga that contains
the bootloader and other stuff. The Kickstart ROM can either be dumped
from a real Amiga using a tool like Amiga Explorer for Windows.
Alternatively you can buy the Kickstart ROM from AmigaForever. More
details here:

The Kickstart ROMs are copyrighted. You should obtain them legally.

Launcher
========

The majority of emulator configuration, including the import of Kickstarts,
can now be done via the launcher. This is now an external package
(emulators/fs-uae-launcher).

Useful Keyboard Shortcuts
=========================

The keyboard shortcuts you absolutely need to know are:

F12:		                Show menu.
Alt + Enter:	            Toggle fullscreen.
Middle click/Alt + G/F12:	Release mouse from FS-UAE.

If you have no real joystick configured, you can use the keyboard:

cursor keys:            directions.
right ctrl/right alt:   fire.

FS-UAE is Slow?
===============

Play with 'video_sync' and 'accuracy' in the config file.
