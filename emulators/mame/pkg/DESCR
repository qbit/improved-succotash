MAME, formerly was an acronym which stood for Multi Arcade Machine Emulator,
documents and reproduces through emulation the inner components of arcade
machines, computers, consoles, chess computers, calculators, and many other
types of electronic amusement machines. As a nice side-effect, MAME allows
to use on a modern PC those programs and games which were originally
developed for the emulated machines.
