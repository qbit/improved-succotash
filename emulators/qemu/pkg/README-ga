To use qemu-ga, configure QEMU to present the guest agent interface as
an isa-serial port.

If you use Proxmox Virtual Environment, you can do this in the "Options"
section; edit "QEMU Guest Agent", enable it, tick the box to show advanced
settings, and set "Type" to ISA.

An rc.d(8) script is provided; as usual you can enable it to start at
boot with:

# rcctl enable qemu_ga

By default the script uses /dev/cua01 for the connection as would be
the case where you have also enabled a serial console device. If you have
not done this and the Guest Agent interface is on a different port, set
that with e.g.

# rcctl set qemu_ga flags -t /var/run/qemu-ga \
	-f /var/run/qemu-ga/qemu-ga.pid -m isa-serial -p /dev/cua00

Currently only a basic set of commands are available via this interface.
