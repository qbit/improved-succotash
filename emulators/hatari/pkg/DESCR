Hatari is an Atari ST/STE/TT/Falcon emulator.

Hatari supports the emulation of most of the ST and STE hardware, including
some special tricks like raster interrupts, border effects and PSG sample
sound. Unlike many other Atari ST emulators which try to give you a good
environment for running GEM applications, Hatari tries to emulate the
hardware of a ST as close as possible so that it is able to run most of
the old ST games and demos.
