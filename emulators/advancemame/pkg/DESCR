AdvanceMAME is an unofficial MAME version with an advanced video support
for helping the use with TVs, Arcade Monitors, Fixed Frequencies Monitors
and also with normal PC Monitors.

AdvanceMAME supports many special video effects to improve image quality
when it's stretched. The most advanced effects add missing pixels trying
to match the image patterns.
