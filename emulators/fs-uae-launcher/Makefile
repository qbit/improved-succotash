# The fs-uae-launcher distfile contains some bundled Python deps:
#
#  - OpenGL: We use py-opengl from the ports tree instead.
#
#  - A modified (stripped down) version amitools: For now we do use this, but
#    if a dedicated port of amitools appears later, we can use it instead.
#
#  - oyoyo: At the time of writing is at version 0.0.0dev (since 2012) so it
#    hardly seems worth making a port for.

# fs-uae-launcher shouldn't be installed into the system Python tree as it
# contains some modules whose names clash with unrelated modules on PyPI
# (arcade, workspace, launcher). To avoid future name clashes, we install into
# a custom location and patch the top-level script to update the PYTHONPATH.
