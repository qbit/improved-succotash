| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD

/etc/login.conf
===============

Dolphin allocates a large amount of memory at startup. You may need to increase
the datasize limit to more than 16G to run dolphin. In ksh(1) run:

	$ ulimit -d 17000000

or adjust the datasize entry for your user class in login.conf(5).

Audio
=====

Config > Audio and under Backend Settings set Audio Backend: Cubeb.

Performance issues
==================

If audio is stuttering and the framerate is unstable consider the following:
  - Audio off will have good graphics performance
  - Audio on will have worse graphics performance
  - Compile a custom OpenBSD kernel to use 1000 ticks for the best possible
    audio and graphics performance
