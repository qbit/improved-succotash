This set of modules provides the CSS-specific interfaces described in the
W3C DOM recommendation.

The CSS::DOM class itself implements the StyleSheet and CSSStyleSheet DOM
interfaces.

This set of modules has two modes:

1. It can validate property values, ignoring those that are invalid (just
like a real web browser), and support shorthand properties. This means you
can set font to '13px/15px My Font' and have the font-size, line-height, and
font-family properties (among others) set automatically. Also, color: green;
color: kakariki will assign 'green' to the color property, 'kakariki' not
being a recognised color value.

2. It can blithely accept all property assignments as being valid. In the
case of color: green; color: kakariki, 'kakariki' will be assigned, since it
overrides the previous assignment.

These two modes are controlled by the property_parser option to the
constructors.
