| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

squidclamav is not a standalone daemon, it is a module to use with the
c-icap service container.

To enable it, edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/c-icap/c-icap.conf and add this line:

	Service squidclamav squidclamav.so

Review the other settings in c-icap's configuration file and
${SYSCONFDIR}/squidclamav.conf and make any changes needed (in particular
check the clamd socket location matches clamd's configuration).
When happy, start c-icap (and add to "pkg_scripts" in rc.conf.local(8)
if wanted):

	${RCDIR}/c_icap start

To make use of this from Squid, your configuration should have lines
like this (adapted from http://squidclamav.darold.net/installv6.html):

	icap_enable on
	icap_send_client_ip on
	icap_send_client_username on
	icap_client_username_encode off
	icap_client_username_header X-Authenticated-User
	icap_preview_enable on
	icap_preview_size 1024
	icap_service service_req reqmod_precache bypass=1 \
	    icap://127.0.0.1:1344/squidclamav
	adaptation_access service_req allow all
	icap_service service_resp respmod_precache bypass=1 \
	    icap://127.0.0.1:1344/squidclamav
	adaptation_access service_resp allow all

The "icap_service" lines are split for this README, but should be
entered on one line.
