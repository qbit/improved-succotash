| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial configuration
=====================
By default gitea listens on all configured IP addresses, TCP port 3000.
If this is not wanted behavior, either adjust your pf(4) rules or change
HTTP_ADDR/HTTP_PORT in ${SYSCONFDIR}/gitea/app.ini.

To complete the initial configuration, point your browser to
http://gitea.example.com:3000 and press "Sign In". Usually you'll need to
configure SSH Server Domain/Port, Gitea HTTP Listen Port/Base URL, E-Mail
Settings and Administrator Account Settings.

On OpenBSD, initial gitea configuration has the following restrictions:

 - Self-Registration is disabled
 - Sign-In is required to view the content
 - E-Mail addresses are not shown
 - Server runs in "offline" mode, which means that external services such as
   Gravatar/OpenID are not used
 - New repositories have "private" checkbox checked by default
 - Password hash algorithm changed from pbkdf2 to argon2

Adjust these configuration settings according to your requirements.

Configuring HTTP access
=======================
By default gitea serves HTTP requests on its own.
It can also be configured to run behind HTTP proxy like relayd(8) or nginx(8).

Another option is to let OpenBSD httpd(8) serve HTTP(S) requests and pass it
to gitea via FastCGI protocol:

Example configuration for httpd(8) and gitea communicating via FastCGI
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Relevant configuration directives in ${SYSCONFDIR}/httpd.conf:

	# An HTTPS server using SSL/TLS
	server "gitea.example.com" {
		listen on $ext_addr tls port 443
		tls certificate "/etc/ssl/gitea.example.com.pem"
		tls key "/etc/ssl/private/gitea.example.com.key"
		location "*" { fastcgi socket "/run/gitea/gitea.sock" }
	}

Relevant configuration directives in ${SYSCONFDIR}/gitea/app.ini:

	[server]
	PROTOCOL               = fcgi+unix
	DOMAIN                 = gitea.example.com
	ROOT_URL               = https://%(DOMAIN)s/
	HTTP_ADDR              = /var/www/run/gitea/gitea.sock
	LOCAL_ROOT_URL         = %(ROOT_URL)s

Customizing gitea
=================
For custom public files, templates, gitignores, labels, licenses and READMEs,
please use ${LOCALSTATEDIR}/gitea/custom directory.
