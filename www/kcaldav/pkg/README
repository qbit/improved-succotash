| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Administrator Quick Start
=========================
  Create users by running:

    doas kcaldav.passwd -C -u <user> -e email -f /var/www/caldav
    doas chown www:www /var/www/caldav/kcaldav.db
    doas chmod 640 /var/www/caldav/kcaldav.db

  Read kcaldav.passwd(1) for more details about creating new
  calenders for users, changing email address and other options.

  With httpd(8) the kcaldav CGI can be run through slowcgi(8)
  using a configuration snippet like the following:

    server "default" {
        listen on * tls port 443

        tls {
            certificate "/etc/ssl/example.net.crt"
            key "/etc/ssl/private/example.net.key"
        }
        location "/cgi-bin/*" {
            fastcgi
            root "/"
        }
    }

  Remember to enable and start slowcgi(8):

    rcctl enable slowcgi
    rcttl start slowcgi

  Also, kcaldav.cgi uses http authentication for user security.
  Make sure your web server is configured to use https to ensure
  privacy of connection.


User Quick Start
================
  Users can manage their account settings, create calendars,
  and find the URL for use with their calendar application by
  browsing to:

    https://example.org/kcaldav/home.html

  The URL will look like:

    https://example.org/cgi-bin/kcaldav/<username>/


Porting Notes: Write Ahead Logging
==================================
  As implemented in the original source, kcaldav use sqlite3(3)
  Write Ahead Logging (WAL). WAL requires write access to /tmp.

  This port disables WAL due to the expectation kcaldav will be
  running in a chroot environment which may not have a /tmp dir.

  To re-enable WAL:

  Open the kcaldav.db:

    doas sqlite3 caldav/kcaldav.db

  Type:

    sqlite> PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;

  To disable WAL, open the kcaldav db and type:

    sqlite> PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE;

  If you plan to run kcaldav in a chroot environment you must
  create a /tmp directory in the chroot dir and make it writable
  by the httpd daemon account:

    doas mkdir /var/www/tmp
    doas chown www:daemon /var/www/tmp
    doas chmod 755 /var/www/tmp

  For more details about WAL and temp directory requirements
  see:

  https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html
  https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/temp_directory.html


Porting Notes: Debug and Logging
================================

  Logging in kcaldav is controlled by the LOGFILE and DEBUG
  variables in the Makefile. LOGFILE sets the name and location
  of the file to write to, DEBUG controls the amount of logging.

  The DEBUG level can only be set at build time. There are four
  DEBUG levels in ascending order of verbosity: 0 - 3, where 0
  disables all debugging. This port disables logging by commenting
  out the Makefile line:

    CFLAGS  	+= -DLOGFILE=\"$(LOGFILE)\".

  When sending error reports upstream, re-enable the line above,
  set DEBUG=3, and rebuild.

  LOGFILE defaults to /var/www/logs/kcaldav-system.log. This file
  must be created by the user and permissions set:

    touch /var/www/logs/kcaldav-system.log
    chown www:www /var/www/logs/kcaldav-system.log
    chmod 644 /var/www/logs/kcaldav-system.log
