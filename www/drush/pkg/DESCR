Drush is a command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal,
allowing most administration tasks to be done without using the web
interface.

It ships with lots of useful commands for interacting with code like
modules/themes/profiles, it is able to run updates, execute sql queries
and DB migrations, and other utilities like running cron or clearing
cache. Drush can be extended by 3rd party commandfiles.

Note that drush should be invoked from the directory where Drupal is
installed, or using the -r option.
