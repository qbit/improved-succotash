phpVirtualBox is an open source, AJAX implementation of the VirtualBox
user interface written in PHP. As a modern web interface, it allows you
to access and control remote VirtualBox instances. Much of its verbage
and some of its code is based on the (inactive) vboxweb project.
phpVirtualBox was designed to allow users to administer VirtualBox in a
headless environment - mirroring the VirtualBox GUI through its web
interface.
