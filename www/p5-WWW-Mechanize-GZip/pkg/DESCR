The WWW::Mechanize::GZip module tries to fetch a URL by requesting
gzip-compression from the web server. If such compression is not
available, the content will be available nonetheless.

This module is a direct subclass of WWW::Mechanize and will therefore
support any method provided by WWW::Mechanize.
