ASQL is a simple tool to allow you to query Apache common logfiles 
via SQL. (Only "Apache common" logfiles are currently supported.)
When asql starts up it creates a temporary SQLite database to hold 
the contents of the parsed logfile(s) you might load. This temporary 
database may then be queried directly via SQL.
