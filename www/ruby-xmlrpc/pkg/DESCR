XMLRPC is a lightweight protocol that enables remote procedure calls
over HTTP. It is defined at http://www.xmlrpc.com.

XMLRPC allows you to create simple distributed computing solutions that
span computer languages. Its distinctive feature is its simplicity
compared to other approaches like SOAP and CORBA.

The Ruby standard library package 'xmlrpc' enables you to create a
server that implements remote procedures and a client that calls them.
Very little code is required to achieve either of these.
