This package contains the W3C Link Checker. It checks HTML pages for
links pointing to resources that have been moved or no longer exist.

The link checker can be run as a CGI script in a web server as well as on
the command line.  The CGI version provides a HTML interface as seen at
<http://validator.w3.org/checklink>.
