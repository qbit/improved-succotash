E2Guardian is a web proxy that filters the actual content of pages based
on various methods including phrase matching, PICS filtering and URL
filtering.

E2Guardian is designed to be completely flexible and allows you to
tailor the filtering to your exact needs. It can be as draconian or as
unobstructive as you want. The default settings are geared towards what
a primary school might want but E2Guardian puts you in control of what
you want to block.
