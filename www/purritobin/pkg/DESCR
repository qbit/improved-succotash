Purrito Bin is an ultra fast, minimalistic, encrypted command
line paste-bin server written in C++ for handling large number
of requests.

It is very easy to integrate with any standard http server such as
httpd(8), apache or nginx and follows the KISS principle towards
handling pastes. It supports pledge(2) and unveil(2) in OpenBSD
to be secure to outside script attacks.
