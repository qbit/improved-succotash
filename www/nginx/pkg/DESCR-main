This is the stable branch of nginx, as distributed by nginx.org.

nginx provides FastCGI and reverse HTTP proxying, with or without caching,
including simple load balancing and fault tolerance.

It has a modular architecture.  Filters include gzipping, byte ranges,
chunked responses, and SSI.  Multiple SSI inclusions within a single page
can be processed in parallel if they are handled by FastCGI or proxied
servers.  SSL and TLS SNI are supported.
