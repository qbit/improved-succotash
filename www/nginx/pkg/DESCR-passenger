This is the nginx module adding support for Phusion Passenger.

Phusion Passenger is a web server and application server, designed to be fast,
robust and lightweight. It takes a lot of complexity out of deploying web apps,
adds powerful enterprise-grade features that are useful in production, and makes
administration much easier and less complex. Phusion Passenger supports Ruby,
Python, Node.js and Meteor, and is being used by high-profile companies such as
Apple, Pixar, New York Times, AirBnB, Juniper etc as well as over 350.000
websites.

What makes it so fast and reliable is its C++ core, its zero-copy architecture,
its watchdog system and its hybrid evented, multi-threaded and multi-process
design.
