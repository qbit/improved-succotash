This nginx module allows a server to provide direct downloads of
resources but only where a "secure URL" is known. This is based on
a URL token including an HMAC based on various parameters such as
the path, remote IP address, and a timestamp/expiry (all optional).
The token can be generated on a separate web application server
and validated on a simpler web server using a shared secret.

It is similar to the Secure Link module described in
https://www.nginx.com/blog/securing-urls-secure-link-module-nginx-plus/
however it can use any type of hash supported by libcrypto rather than
being limited to MD5.
