+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites
=============

Per https://github.com/nextcloud/notify_push#requirements
${PKGSTEM} requires that nextcloud is configured to use a redis cache. Refer to
nextcloud documentation for this.

Running the service
===================

once the service is enabled and started, the nextcloud virtualhost should be
modified so that /push/ location on the nextcloud virtual host points at the
websocket provided by the service.

examples are provided at https://github.com/nextcloud/notify_push#reverse-proxy
see below for nginx:

location ^~ /push/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7867/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}

Setting up the service
======================

the notify_push nextcloud app needs to be installed and configured, the occ
commands has the notify_push:setup subcommand for that, per
https://github.com/nextcloud/notify_push#nextcloud-app

$doas -u www /var/www/nextcloud/occ notify_push:setup https://nextcloud_fqdn/push
- redis is configured
- push server is receiving redis messages
- push server can load mount info from database
- push server can connect to the Nextcloud server
- push server is a trusted proxy
- push server is running the same version as the app
  configuration saved

depending on webserver setup, a common issue is the IP of the server not being
in trusted_proxies in nextcloud config.php, see
https://github.com/nextcloud/notify_push#push-server-is-not-a-trusted-proxy for
details.

adding this to config.php usually solves the issue:

  'trusted_proxies' =>
  array (
    0 => 'server.public.ip'
  ),
