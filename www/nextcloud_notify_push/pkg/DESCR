This nextcloud service attempts to solve the issue where Nextcloud clients have
to periodically check the server if any files have been changed. In order to
keep sync snappy, clients wants to check for updates often, which increases the
load on the server.

With many clients all checking for updates a large portion of the server load
can consist of just these update checks.

By providing a way for the server to send update notifications to the clients,
the need for the clients to make these checks can be greatly reduced.
