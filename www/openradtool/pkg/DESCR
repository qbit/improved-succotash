openradtool ("ort") is an open source RAD tool generating front-end code
(JavaScript, TypeScript) and back-end code (SQL, C) for your
application, leaving you to develop your "middle-tier" business and
presentation logic.

The system consists of a set of source generators, each accepting a
single ort(5) configuration file that describes your data and how it is
accessed, modified, created, deleted. The generated sources have a
strong focus on security, documentation, and auditability.
