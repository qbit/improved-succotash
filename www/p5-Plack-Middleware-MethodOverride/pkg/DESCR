Writing RESTful apps is a good thing, but if you're also trying to
support web browsers, it would be nice not to be reduced to GET
and POST for everything.

This middleware allows for POST requests that pretend to be something
else: by adding either a header named X-HTTP-Method-Override to the
request, or a query parameter named x-tunneled-method to the URI, the
client can say what method it actually meant.
