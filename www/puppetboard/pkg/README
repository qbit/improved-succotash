| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

puppetboard has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

Please be aware that this is still experimental software and may not
be production ready.

Configuration
-------------
You can configure the PuppetDB host and port through
${INSTDIR}/puppetboard/default_settings.py

PuppetDB
--------
Puppetboard requires PuppetDB 4, however compatability with PuppetDB 3
is available (though PuppetDB 3 was never ported to OpenBSD).

    pkg_add puppetdb

Starting puppetboard
--------------------

By default Puppetboard will bind to 127.0.0.1:8000, to adjust this
puppetboard_flags will need to be set in /etc/rc.conf.local. Please refer to the
gunicorn documentation for the available options.
