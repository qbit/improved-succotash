Varnish Cache is a web application accelerator also known as a caching
HTTP reverse proxy. You install it in front of any server that speaks
HTTP and configure it to cache the contents.

Varnish Cache is really, really fast. It typically speeds up delivery
with a factor of 300 - 1000x, depending on your architecture.
