youtube-dl is a small command-line program for downloading videos
from YouTube.com and many other sites.

To list all supported extractors and the URLs they can handle, use:

$ youtube-dl --list-extractors

To retrieve RTMP streams, install the rtmpdump package.

Note: also see the fork of this in the "yt-dlp" package.
