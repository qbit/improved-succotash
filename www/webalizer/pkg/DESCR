Webalizer is a web server log file analysis program which produces usage
statistics in HTML format for viewing with a browser.  The results are
presented in both columnar and graphical format, which facilitates
interpretation.  Yearly, monthly, daily and hourly usage statistics are
presented, along with the ability to display usage by site, URL,
referrer, user agent (browser), search string, entry/exit page, username
and country (some information is only available if supported and present
in the log files being processed).  Processed data may also be exported
into most database and spreadsheet programs that support tab delimited
data formats.

The OpenBSD port enables Reverse-DNS lookup by default.
