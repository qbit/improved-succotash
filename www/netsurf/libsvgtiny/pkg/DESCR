Libsvgtiny is an implementation of SVG Tiny, written in C. It is currently
in development for use with NetSurf and is intended to be suitable for use
in other projects too.

The overall idea of the library is to take some SVG as input, and return a
list of paths and texts which can be rendered easily. The library does not
do the actual rendering.
