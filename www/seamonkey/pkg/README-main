Debugging
=========
If you encounter crashes, you might want to build the debug FLAVOR of
this package, and run seamonkey inside gdb, so that you can gather
debugging logs and traces (for all threads !).
Bug reports without that information will be ignored.

Html5 audio/video support
=========================
For a full multimedia experience, such as playing MP3 audio or MPEG
videos, install the "ffmpeg" package:

# pkg_add ffmpeg
