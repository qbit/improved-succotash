Linux Libertine is a serif proportional font that looks like 19th
century book type, but includes features designed for modern use.
It contains more than 2000 Unicode characters, including support
for many different languages of the western Latin, Greek, Cyrillic
and Hebrew typeset. Additionally it offers several ligatures.  The
OpenType implementation allows automatic positioning and substitution
including true fractions, ligatures and kerning.
