Public Sans is a strong, neutral, principles-driven, open-source typeface
for text or display. Developed by the US government's General Services
Administration, it is a fork of the SIL Open Licensed face Libre Franklin.
Public Sans has many similarities with its parent, but differs in its focus
on longform reading and neutral UI applicability. It takes inspiration from
geometric sans faces of the 20th century, as well as the original Franklins
of the 19th, resulting in something of a mongrel face that retains its
American origin.
