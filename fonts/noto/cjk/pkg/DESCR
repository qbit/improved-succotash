Noto Sans CJK is a sans serif typeface designed as an intermediate style
between the modern and traditional. It is intended to be a multi-purpose
digital font for user interface designs, digital content, reading on
laptops, mobile devices, and electronic books. Noto Sans CJK comprehensively
covers Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean in a
unified font family. It supports regional variants of ideographic characters
for each of the four languages. In addition, it supports Japanese kana,
vertical forms, and variant characters (itaiji); it supports Korean hangeul,
both contemporary and archaic.
