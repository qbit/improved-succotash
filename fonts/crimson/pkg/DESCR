Crimson is a free and open-source text type family.

The font is designed in the tradition of beautiful oldstyle type,
and inspired particularly by the fantastic work of people like Jan
Tschichold (Sabon), Robert Slimbach (Arno, Minion) and Jonathan Hoefler
(Hoefler Text). It features

- six cuts (regular, semibold and bold; with a Roman and Italic each)

- characters for a wide range of European languages - though some are
still better supported than others between different cuts

- spacing/kerning done by Igino Marini's spectacular iKern

- an unbeatable price of zero!
