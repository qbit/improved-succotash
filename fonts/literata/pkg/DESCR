Literata is a contemporary serif typeface family, intended for long-form
reading especially in eBooks. It was commisioned for exclusive use by
Google Play Books in 2014, and released under the SIL Open Font License
for everyone in January 2019 with a Variable Font "Weight" axis.

The Literata project was commissioned by Google from TypeTogether, an
international type design foundry.
