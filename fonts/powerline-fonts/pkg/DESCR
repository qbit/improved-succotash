Powerline is a statusline plugin for vim, and provides statuslines and
prompts for several other applications, including zsh, bash, tmux,
IPython, Awesome and Qtile.

Powerline uses several special glyphs to get the arrow effect and some
custom symbols for developers. This requires that you either have a
symbol font or a patched font on your system. Your terminal emulator
must also support either patched fonts or fontconfig for Powerline to
work properly.

This package contains a number of fonts which are derived from standard
fonts (Anonymous Pro, DejaVu Sans Mono, Droid Sans Mono, Inconsolata,
Inconsolata-dz, Liberation Mono, Meslo, Source Code Pro, Terminus,
Ubuntu Mono) by patching them to add these glyphs.
