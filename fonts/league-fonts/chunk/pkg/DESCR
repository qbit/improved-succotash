Chunk is an ultra-bold serif typeface by Meredith Mandel.

Chunk is an ultra-bold slab serif typeface that is reminiscent of old
American Western woodcuts, broadsides, and newspaper headlines. Used
mainly for display, the fat block lettering is unreserved yet refined
for contemporary use.

In 2014, a new textured style was created by Tyler Finck called Chunk
Five Print. It contains the same glyphs as the original.
