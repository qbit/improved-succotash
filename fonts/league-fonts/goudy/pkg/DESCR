Sorts Mill Goudy is a 'revival' of Goudy Oldstyle and Italic, with features
including small capitals (in the roman only), oldstyle and lining figures,
superscripts and subscripts, fractions, ligatures, class-based kerning,
case-sensitive forms, and capital spacing. There is support for many
languages using latin scripts.
