Adopted by Mozilla for the Firefox for Android browser, Clear Sans has been
recognized as a versatile OpenType font for screen, print, and Web. Clear
Sans was designed with on-screen legibility in mind. It strikes a balance
between contemporary, professional, and stylish expression and thoroughly
functional purpose. It has a sophisticated and elegant personality at all
sizes, and its thoughtful design becomes even more evident at the thin
weight.

It has minimized, unambiguous characters and slightly narrow proportions,
making it ideal for UI design. Its strong, recognizable forms avoid
distracting ambiguity, making Clear Sans comfortable for reading short UI
labels and long passages in both screen and print.

This font supports a wide range of languages using Latin, Cyrillic, and
Greek scripts. The font family includes medium, regular, thin, and light
weights with upright, italic, and bold styles.
