Mada is a modernist, low-contrast Arabic typeface based largely on
the typeface seen in Cairo metro old signage which was designed by
Professor Fathi Gouda of Faculty of Applied Arts, Helwan University.

Mada is characterised by low descenders, open contours and low-contrast
forms making it suitable for small point sizes, user interfaces,
signage or low resolution settings.

Mada can work also as a display typeface giving modernist and
simplistic feeling.

Mada comes in 7 weights (ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold,
Bold and Black), as well as an interpolatable variable font that
can provide any intermediate weight on the fly.
