UW ttyp0 is a family of bitmap programmer's fonts. It covers most of the Latin
and Cyrillic alphabet, Greek, Armenian, Georgian (only Mkhedruli), Hebrew
(without cantillation marks), Thai, most of IPA (but no UPA), standard
punctuation, common symbols, some mathematics, line graphics, a few dingbats,
and Powerline delimiter symbols. For many characters, several stylistic
variants are provided (e.g., regular, dotted, or slashed zero, raised or
centered tilde and asterisk, Russian, Serbian, or Bulgarian Cyrillic
characters), that can be selected at build time. In addition to Unicode
(ISO 10646-1), UW ttyp0 supports about thirty 8-bit encodings (code pages).

UW ttyp0 comes in nine sizes from 6x11 to 11x22. In all of the sizes there are
regular and bold versions; for some there is also a (somewhat experimental)
italic.

Flavors:
	sq		- straight accent and apostrophe
	sz		- slashed zero
	ct		- centered ASCII tilde
	nbs		- display no-break space like normal space
			  (this font displays it as a box by default)
	nbd		- display no-break space with a dot
