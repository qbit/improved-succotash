Luciole (French fo "firefly") is a new typeface developed explicitly for
visually impaired people. The result of a two-year collaboration between the
Centre Technique Regional pour la Deficience Visuelle (the Regional Technical
Center for Visual Impairment) and the type-design studio typographies.fr, this
project received a grant from the Swiss Ceres Foundation and support from the
DIPHE laboratory at the Universite Lumiere Lyon 2.
