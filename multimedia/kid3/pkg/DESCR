If you want to easily tag multiple MP3, Ogg/Vorbis, FLAC, MPC, MP4/AAC, MP2,
Opus, Speex, TrueAudio, WavPack, WMA, WAV and AIFF files (e.g. full albums)
without typing the same information again and again and have control over both
ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags, then Kid3 is the program you are looking for.
