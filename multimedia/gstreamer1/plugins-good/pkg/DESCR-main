This is GStreamer, a framework for streaming media.
This package contains the "good" elements for gstreamer-${API}.

    "Such ingratitude.  After all the times I've saved your life."

A collection of plug-ins you'd want to have right next to you on the
battlefield.  Shooting sharp and making no mistakes, these plug-ins have
it all: good looks, good code, and good licensing.  Documented and
dressed up in tests.  If you're looking for a role model to base your
own plug-in on, here it is.
