Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it is
a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either
greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the
amount you learn.

Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit from
Anki. Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos
and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless. For
example:

- learning a language

- studying for medical and law exams

- memorizing people's names and faces

- brushing up on geography

- mastering long poems

- even practicing guitar chords!

There are two simple concepts behind Anki: active recall testing
and spaced repetition. They are not known to most learners, despite
having been written about in the scientific literature for many years.
Understanding how they work will make you a more effective learner.
