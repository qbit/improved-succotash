DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader automates the definition of a
DBIx::Class::Schema by scanning database table definitions and setting
up the columns, primary keys, unique constraints and relationships.

DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader currently supports only the DBI storage
type. It has explicit support for DBD::Pg, DBD::mysql, DBD::DB2,
DBD::Firebird, DBD::InterBase, DBD::Informix, DBD::SQLAnywhere,
DBD::SQLite, DBD::Sybase (for Sybase ASE and MSSSQL), DBD::ODBC
(for MSSQL, MSAccess, Firebird and SQL Anywhere) DBD::ADO (for MSSQL
and MSAccess) and DBD::Oracle. Other DBI drivers may function to a
greater or lesser degree with this loader, depending on how much
of the DBI spec they implement, and how standard their implementation
is.
