The DBI module enables your Perl applications to access multiple
database types transparently. You can connect to PostgreSQL, SQLite,
MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, Informix, Sybase, ODBC and many more without
having to know the different underlying interfaces of each. The API
defined by DBI will work on all these database types and many more.

You can connect to multiple databases of different types at the
same time and easily move data between them. The DBI layer allows
you to do this simply and powerfully.
