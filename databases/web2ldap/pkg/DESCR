web2ldap is a generic Web-based LDAP client which does not make any assumptions
about the tree structure or LDAP schema, kind of a swiss-army knife for
accessing/manipulating LDAP servers without having to configure anything.
It provides a schema browser which displays references/dependencies within an
LDAPv3 schema, and a customizable platform for prototyping LDAP administration
use-cases.
