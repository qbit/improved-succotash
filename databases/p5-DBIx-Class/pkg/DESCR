DBIx::Class is a relational-databases to Objects framework, where you
describe your data tables so that they map to objects.

It can deal with about any DBD driver, including SQLite, Postgres, MySQL,
Oracle, DB2 (on other platforms).

Installing p5-SQL-Translator, p5-Text-CSV, p5-MooseX-Types-JSON,
p5-MooseX-Types-Path-Class will give this package some extra
functionality.  See DBIx::Class::Optional::Dependencies(3p) for details.
