DBIx::Simple provides a simplified interface to DBI, Perl's powerful
database module.

This module is aimed at rapid development and easy maintenance. Query
preparation and execution are combined in a single method, the result
object (which is a wrapper around the statement handle) provides easy
row-by-row and slurping methods.
