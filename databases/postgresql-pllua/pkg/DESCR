PL/Lua is an implementation of Lua as a loadable procedural language for
PostgreSQL: with PL/Lua you can use PostgreSQL functions and triggers
written in the Lua programming language.

PL/Lua brings the power and simplicity of Lua to PostgreSQL, including:
small memory footprint, simple syntax, lexical scoping, functions as
first-class values, and coroutines for non-preemptive threading.
