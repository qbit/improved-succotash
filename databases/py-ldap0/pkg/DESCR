ldap0 provides an object-oriented API to access LDAP directory servers from
Python programs. Mainly it wraps the OpenLDAP 2.x libs for that purpose.
Additionally the package contains some Python modules for:

* parsing and producing LDIF
* handling LDAP URLs
* parse and handle LDAPv3 subschema
* LDAPv3 extended operations and controls
* automatic tests with OpenLDAP server

Upstream warns that this should only be used with upstream's software,
and API stability is not guaranteed.
