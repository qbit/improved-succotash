Enabling TimescaleDB
====================
You will need to edit your postgresql.conf file to include the TimescaleDB
library, and then restart PostgreSQL.

        shared_preload_libraries = 'timescaledb'

Upgrading TimescaleDB
=====================
(Perform a backup beforehand)
You will need to start psql with '-X' and execute :

        ALTER EXTENSION timescaledb UPDATE;

Executing '\dx timescaledb' should show the latest version number.

Telemetry
=========
TimescaleDB telemetry and version checking is disabled by default.

To turn on telemetry for a whole instance, simply include the following line
in your postgresql.conf file:

        timescaledb.telemetry_level=basic

Alternatively, you can enable it from psql:

        ALTER [SYSTEM | DATABASE | USER] { *db_name* | *role_specification* }
            SET timescaledb.telemetry_level=basic;

Then reload the configuration.

To disable it again at a later time, replace 'basic' with 'off' in the above.
