Alembic is a database migrations tool for SQLAlchemy.

* Can emit ALTER statements to a database in order to change
  the structure of tables and other constructs
* Provides a system whereby "migration scripts" may be constructed;
  each script indicates a particular series of steps that can "upgrade" a
  target database to a new version, and optionally a series of steps that can
  "downgrade" similarly, doing the same steps in reverse.
* Allows the scripts to execute in some sequential manner.
