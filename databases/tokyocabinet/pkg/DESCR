Tokyo Cabinet, developed as the successor of QDBM, is a library of
routines for managing a simple file-based key/value database.
Keys and values are serial bytes with variable length; both binary
data and character string can be used as key or value. Data are
organized in a hash table, B+ tree, or fixed-length array.
There is no concept of data tables or data types.
