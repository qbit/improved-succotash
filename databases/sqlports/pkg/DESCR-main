SQLite database of every port in the system. This can be queried through
e.g., sqlitebrowser, or any kind of programming interface.

This schema is mostly optimized for tools, and cumbersome to query by
hand.

Human users are strongly advised to mostly use views on those tables.

The default flavor only looks in PORTSDIR, use nonstrict to heed
PORTSDIR_PATH fully.

The database scheme is documented in sqlports(5)
