sqlbox is an open source C/C++ secure database access library at this
time limited to sqlite3 databases. (postgresql is in the planning
phase.) Instead of operating databases in-process, sqlbox uses a
multi-process, resource-separated approach to safe-guard the database
from the calling application.
