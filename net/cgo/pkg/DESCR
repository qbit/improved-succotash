cgo is a UNIX/Linux terminal based gopher client. It relies on external
programs to display media the client cannot itself display (such as
images, music, or HTML pages).

cgo defaults to using Firefox to display HTML pages, mplayer for music
and video, and display (from the ImageMagick package) for images. These
preferences are hardcoded into the source file; to use different
programs, you must edit the source file yourself.
