NRPE is an addon for Nagios that allows you to execute "local" plugins
(like check_disk, check_procs, etc.) on remote hosts. The check_nrpe
plugin is called from Nagios and makes plugin execution requests to the
NRPE daemon running on the remote host (either as a standalone daemon
or as a service under inetd).

WARNING: NRPE is deprecated upstream and no longer receives bug fixes or
new features. For some of the checks on remote servers that you might
otherwise make using NRPE, you may like to consider "manubolon-snmp" and
an SNMP daemon instead.
