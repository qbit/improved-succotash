natpmpd is a daemon that can be used on an OpenBSD NAT gateway to
provide support for the NAT-PMP protocol on any internal networks which
then allows a client to create and maintain rules in pf to map TCP and
UDP connections to the external IP address on the NAT gateway to
services running on the client itself.
