Kea is a new open source DHCPv4/DHCPv6 server being developed by Internet
Systems Consortium. The objective of this project is to provide a very
high-performance, extensible DHCP server engine for use by enterprises and
service providers, either as is or with extensions and modifications.

Kea provides DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers, a dynamic DNS update module, a portable
DHCP library, libdhcp++, and a DHCP benchmarking tool, perfdhcp.
