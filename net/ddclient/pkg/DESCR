DDclient is a Perl client used to update host records at various free
and paid-for "dynamic DNS" providers with your current IP address.

It uses various methods to fetch your current address (either from the
local machine, a local router, or various web lookup services) and
supports various providers (see https://ddclient.net/protocols.html).
