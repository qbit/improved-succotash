This python module controls and monitors Tuya compatible WiFi Smart
Devices (Plugs, Switches, Lights, Window Covers, etc.) using the
local area network (LAN). This is a compatible replacement for the
pytuya PyPi module.

Tuya devices are designed to communicate with the TuyaCloud but
most also expose a local area network API, allowing us to directly
control the devices without using the cloud. This python module
provides a socket based way to poll status and issue commands to
these devices.

NOTE: This module requires the devices to have already been activated
by Smart Life App (or similar).
