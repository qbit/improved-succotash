Grsync is a rsync GUI (Graphical User Interface). Rsync is the
well-known and powerful command line directory and file
synchronization tool. It can be effectively used to synchronize local
directories and it supports remote targets as well (even though it
doesn't support browsing the remote folder).

Sample uses of grsync include, among others:
* synchronize a music collection with removable devices
* backup personal files to a networked drive
* replication of a partition to another one
* mirroring of files

The "Run as superuser" feature relies on pkexec, provided by the
policykit package.
