Deluge is a lightweight, Free Software, cross-platform BitTorrent client.

Deluge contains the common features to BitTorrent clients such as Protocol
Encryption, DHT, Local Peer Discovery (LSD), Peer Exchange (PEX), UPnP,
NAT-PMP, Proxy support, Web seeds, global and per-torrent speed limits.

Deluge has been designed to run as both a normal standalone desktop
application and as a client-server. In Thinclient mode a Deluge daemon
handles all the BitTorrent activity and is able to run on headless machines
with the user-interfaces connecting remotely from any other platform.
