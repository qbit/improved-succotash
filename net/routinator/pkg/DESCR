"Routinator 3000" is RPKI relying party software written in Rust.

The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) provides cryptographically
signed statements about the association of Internet routing resources.
In particular, it allows the holder of an IP address prefix to publish
which AS number will be the origin of BGP route announcements for it.

Routinator connects to the Trust Anchors of the five Regional Internet
Registries (RIRs) - APNIC, AFRINIC, ARIN, LACNIC and RIPE NCC -
downloads all of the certificates and ROAs in the various repositories,
verifies the signatures and makes the result available for use in the
BGP workflow. It can perform RPKI validation as a one-time operation
and store the result on disk in formats such as CSV, JSON and RPSL,
or run as a service that periodically fetches and verifies RPKI data.
The data is then served via the built-in HTTP server, or fetched from
RPKI-capable routers via the RPKI-RTR protocol.
