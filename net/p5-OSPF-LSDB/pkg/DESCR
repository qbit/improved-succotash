OSPFView Perl module OSPF::LSDB reads the link-state database from
an OSPF daemon.  Then it creates a dot graphic which can be displayed
with graphviz.

The OSPF::LSDB Perl module and its submodules implement the
functionality to hold, parse, check, display the content of an OSPF
link-state database.

Additionally the OSPFView package contains command-line tools to
read the link-state database from an ospf daemon.  Then it creates
a dot graphic which can be displayed with graphviz.  At the moment
OpenBSD ospfd and ospf6d and gated 3.6 are supported.  Cisco support
is experimental.
