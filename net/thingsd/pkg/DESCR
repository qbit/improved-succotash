The thingsd OpenBSD proxy daemon provides a mechanism for clients and client
processes to communicate with an array of serial and IoT things. At its core,
thingsd is primarily a data aggregator and repeater, in that it waits for
packets to swap between subscriber clients and things. However, thingsd also
provides password control over those connections, including client limits.

On the client side, thingsd sets up TCP/IP sockets to transmit packets to and
from things. On the server side, thingsd can connect to any serial device which
has a viable file descriptor, create a persistent connection to the IP address
of a device transmitting packets, or setup a UDP listener on the network to
receive broadcasted packets. Devices tested include: ESP8266/ESP32 modules, on
both the serial and network sides, XBee Series 2 coordinators connected in a
mesh network, and NF24 devices. To transmit to an IP address, which does not
allow persistence, thingsd will create an ad hoc connection, transmit a packet,
and detach. The thingsd proxy daemon is agnostic about packet data.
