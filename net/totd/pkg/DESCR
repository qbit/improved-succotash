Totd is a small DNS proxy nameserver that supports IPv6 only hosts/networks
that communicate with the IPv4 world using some translation mechanism, for
example application level translators such as the old KAME faithd(8) which
was formerly present in OpenBSD, and PF's af-to feature.

Note that for new configurations, it is generally preferred to use a
DNS64-capable recursive name server, e.g. later versions of BIND 9.
