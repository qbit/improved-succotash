dhcpcd is a DHCPv4/IPv4LL/IPv6RS/DHCPv6 quad stack client.
It will listen for new interfaces and carrier signals from the kernel
so it can quickly configure each interface as it appears.

dhcpcd has a powerful DHCP expression engine which makes it easy
to decode future RFC DHCP options, or handroll your own.
