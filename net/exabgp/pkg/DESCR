ExaBGP is software which speaks BGP. It is used for injecting routes
or performing complex route mangling with BGP, it is not intended to
transform a server into a BGP router.

Potential uses include:

 - injecting routes for service IPs (e.g. anycasting health-checked services)
 - injecting flowspec routes, possibly to handle DDOS
 - adding the received default route to a host
 - filtering and/or modifying routes using your own logic
 - tracking changes in the global routing table
 - passing received routes in text/JSON form to a third-party application
