Before starting softflowd(8), "softflowd_flags" needs to be modified in
rc.conf.local(8) to listen on a network interface as a minimum.

For example:

	softflowd_flags=-i em0
		This would cause softflowd(8) to listen on interface
		em0 and to run in statistics gathering mode only (i.e.
		no NetFlow data export).

	softflowd_flags=-i fxp0 -n 10.1.0.2:4432
		This would cause softflowd(8) to listen on interface
		fxp0 and to export NetFlow v.5 datagrams on flow expiry
		to a flow collector running on 10.1.0.2 port 4432.

In both statistics-only and export mode, the running daemon can be
controlled (i.e. pause data collection, expire or delete flows, etc.)
and queried for statistics using the softflowctl(8) control program.
