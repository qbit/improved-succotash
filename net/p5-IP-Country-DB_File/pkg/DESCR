IP::Country::DB_File is a light-weight module for fast IP address
to country translation based on DB_File. The country code database
is stored in a Berkeley DB file. You have to build the database
using build_ipcc.pl or IP::Country::DB_File::Builder before you can
lookup country codes.

This module tries to be API compatible with the other IP::Country
modules.
