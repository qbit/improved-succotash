dhcdrop is a tool to either reduce the impact of a rogue DHCP server
on a network, or as a stress-test tool for use when configuring
or developing DHCP servers.

It works by flooding the server or attempting to starve it of leasable
addresses; it can be used interactively, or it can be configured with
the MAC addresses of any legitimate DHCP servers, and will attempt to
disrupt any others it sees.
