dnsperf and resperf are free tools that make it simple to gather
accurate latency and throughput metrics for Domain Name Service (DNS).
They read input files describing DNS queries, and send those queries
to DNS servers to measure performance.

resperf-report is a script allowing to generate a report in HTML
format, with graphs.  You will need to install the gnuplot package
to use it.
