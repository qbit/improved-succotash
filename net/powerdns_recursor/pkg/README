Previous version of rec_control(1) would write to file from within
the chroot powerdns_recursor(8) is running in. As of version 4.5.0,
the file are created by the rec_control command, using the credentials
and current working directory of the process running rec_control.
It is also possible to write to stdout by specifying `-' as file.

See https://docs.powerdns.com/recursor/upgrade.html for more details.
