| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting Started
===============

The following information only includes notes specific to use on OpenBSD.
Use them in conjunction with the main Icinga 2 documentation available
in ${PREFIX}/share/doc/icinga2/markdown or online at
http://docs.icinga.org/icinga2/latest/doc.

The included sample configuration carries out some simple checks
on the local machine; these should work as-is.

You may check your configuration file format before starting Icinga:

   # su -m _icinga -c "${PREFIX}/sbin/icinga2 daemon -C"

This will parse all configuration files and warn about any problems
which have been identified.

Enable icinga2 at boot and start it as usual:

   # rcctl enable icinga2
   # rcctl start icinga2

Web User Interface
------------------
The optional Icinga Web 2 user interface can be installed separately,

   # pkg_add icinga-web2

Consult the upstream documentation and the separate pkg-readme for
Icinga Web 2.

It is also possible to use Icinga 2 with the legacy CGI interface,
or with Icinga Web 1, however this has not been tested by the maintainer.

Upgrading from Icinga 1 or Nagios
=================================
Icinga 2 is not a drop-in replacement. Read the "Migration from Icinga 1.x"
and the "Differences between Icinga 1.x and 2" sections in the documentation.

Upgrading from previous versions of Icinga 2
--------------------------------------------
Follow the main documentation in ${PREFIX}/share/doc/icinga2/markdown/.
