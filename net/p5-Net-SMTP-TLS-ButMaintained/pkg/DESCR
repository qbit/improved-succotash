DEPRECATED!, Please use Net::SMTPS instead.

Net::SMTP::TLS::ButMaintained is a TLS and AUTH capable SMTP client
which offers an interface that users will find familiar from Net::SMTP.
Net::SMTP::TLS::ButMaintained implements a subset of the methods
provided by that module, but certainly not (yet) a complete mirror
image of that API.

It is forked from the no-longer-maintained Net::SMTP::TLS.
