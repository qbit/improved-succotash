COMMENT=	BIND stub resolver library for special use cases

# XXX As mentioned in pkg/DESCR:
#
# This port is not for general purpose use and has known issues; it is
# intended *only* for special cases where software relies on resolver
# internals and cannot be adapted to the standard resolver in libc
# or use an alternative library. There are symbol conflicts; expect
# crashes and corruption in some cases.
