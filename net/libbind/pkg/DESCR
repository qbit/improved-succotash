This package provides the ISC libbind DNS resolver.

This port is not for general purpose use and has known issues; it is
intended *only* for special cases where software relies on resolver
internals and cannot be adapted to the standard resolver in libc
or use an alternative library. There are symbol conflicts; expect
crashes and corruption in some cases.
