NetFlow input from pf
---------------------
By default FastNetMon listens on port 2055 for incoming NetFlow data. This can
be obtained from pflow(4). Minimal pf.conf addition to export all states through
pflow(4):

	set state-defaults pflow

And create a pflow0 with:

	# ifconfig pflow0 flowsrc 127.0.0.1 flowdst 127.0.0.1:2055

The default protocol version (5) works fine with FastNetMon.

Configuration
-------------
At the very minimum the known networks need to be recorded in
${SYSCONFDIR}/fastnetmon/networks_list in CIDR notation, otherwise all traffic
is classified as "other traffic".

Also a notification script needs to be configured and installed to actually
perform a ban. A stub is provided in
${PREFIX}/share/examples/fastnetmon/notify_about_attack.sh
