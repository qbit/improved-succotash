| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

munin-node is the "client" side of Munin; it runs on various hosts and
accepts requests from a munin-server, and invokes various plugins to
provide statistics about the host.

Before starting munin-node, you will need to configure access controls
and choose which plugins to use.

Access controls are configured in ${SYSCONFDIR}/munin/munin-node.conf.

Plugins are enabled by creating symlinks in ${SYSCONFDIR}/munin/plugins.
Run "munin-node-configure --shell" to output a set of shell commands to
enable plugins which can be auto-detected. (These commands are not run
automatically, so you can easily choose which you would like to enable).

Some plugins require access to log files which are normally readable only
by root (a common example is /var/log/maillog), but by default the
plugins are run by the "_munin-plugin" user.

You can change permissions and ownership of the log files (and edit
/etc/newsyslog.conf to match). If necessary you can configure the plugin
to run as a different user with the "user" option (see
${SYSCONFDIR}/munin/plugin-conf.d/openbsd-packages).

Log files in /var/log/munin will need to be rotated. Here is a sample
newsyslog.conf fragment:
/var/log/munin/munin-node.log   root:wheel      644  7     250  *     Z

SNMP-based monitors are also available; to use these, install the
p5-Net-SNMP package.
