| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To use igmpproxy on OpenBSD, you will need to configure it by
editing ${SYSCONFDIR}/igmpproxy.conf, and configure the OS for
multicast forwarding:

# echo multicast=YES >> /etc/rc.conf.local
# echo net.inet.ip.mforwarding=1 >> /etc/sysctl.conf

and restart. Note that client machines using OpenBSD should
also be configured with multicast=YES.

Start igmpproxy at boot time in the usual way:

# rcctl enable igmpproxy; rcctl start igmpproxy

PF must be configured so that control packets (proto igmp) and
data packets (destination address within 224.0.0.0/4) are passed.

Running igmpproxy in chroot
---------------------------
igmpproxy can run as an unprivileged user inside chroot when the
chroot and user options are used. To chroot igmpproxy, use the
following as part of your configuration file:

  chroot /var/empty
  user _igmpproxy
