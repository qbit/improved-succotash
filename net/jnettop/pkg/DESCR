Jnettop is a traffic visualiser, which captures traffic going through
the host it is running from and displays streams sorted by bandwidth
they use.

  - list connections going across this host in a nice way
  - supports IPv6
  - supports customizable text output for further analysis
  - supports machine-friendly mode to support further analysis
  - allows pre-configured pcap filters in the config file

If this package is not quite what you need, try iftop (and vice-versa).
