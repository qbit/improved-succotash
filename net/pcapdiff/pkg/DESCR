pcap_diff.py is a tool that takes two or more pcap files as input,
compares them, and produces a pcap file or displays to show differences
between the two. It is useful when comparing packets captured at two
points to identify interference with packets. It has options to ignore
certain parts of the packet (by default ttl, checksums and timestamps
are ignored).
