| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that most zeekctl(8) commands must be run as root.

Post-install steps
==================

Before starting zeek(8) for the first time, the "interface" must be properly
configured under:
    ${SYSCONFDIR}/zeek/node.cfg

And the configuration and policies must be installed and deployed by running:
    zeekctl deploy
This command will run zeekctl(8) with the check, install, and restart
arguments.

It's also recommended to enable housekeeping tasks by adding the following
entry into root's crontab(5):
*/5	*	*	*	*	${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/zeekctl cron

See https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/quickstart/index.html for details.
