This module aims to provide an alternative to the Net::DNS module, based on
the ldns library from NLnet Labs. The module includes the necessary C code,
so the library does not need to be globally installed.

This module is written as part of the Zonemaster project, and therefore
primarily exposes the functionality needed for that. Since Zonemaster is a
diagnostic tool, that means the functions most used are those for looking
things up and inspecting them.

If you want a module that specifically aims to be a complete and
transparent interface to ldns, DNS::LDNS is a better fit than this
module.
