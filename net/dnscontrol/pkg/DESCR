DNSControl is a system for maintaining DNS zones. It has two parts: a
domain specific language (DSL) for describing DNS zones plus software
that processes the DSL and pushes the resulting zones to DNS providers.

You can think of it as a DNS compiler. The configuration files are
written in a DSL that looks a lot like JavaScript. It is compiled to
an intermediate representation (IR). Compiler back-ends use the IR to
update your DNS zones on services such as Route53, Cloudflare, and
Gandi, or systems such as BIND and Active Directory.
