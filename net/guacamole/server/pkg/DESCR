Apache Guacamole is a remote desktop gateway. It allows users to connect
using an HTML5 web browser and access systems using standard remote client
protocols like VNC, RDP, and SSH.

It comprises "guacamole-client", the front-end web application written
in Java which accepts connections from end-users web browsers, and
"guacamole-server" (the guacd proxy daemon and related libraries,
written in C), which runs on a gateway machine, accepting connections
from guacamole-client and connecting out to remote machines using their
standard protocol. Both guacamole-client and guacamole-server can run
on the same machine.

This package is for "guacamole-server".
