These Python bindings to rrdtool are based on the code of the original
Python 2 bindings module for rrdtool by Hye-Shik Chang which are shipped
with the RRDtool distribution. This project is maintained separately to
provide a more pythonic way to install those bindings via PyPI and
include support for Python 3.
