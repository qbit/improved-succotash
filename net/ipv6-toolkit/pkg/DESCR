The SI6 Networks' IPv6 toolkit is a set of IPv6 security assessment
and trouble-shooting tools.  It can be leveraged to perform security
assessments of IPv6 networks, assess the resiliency of IPv6 devices
by performing real-world attacks against them, and to trouble-shoot
IPv6 networking problems.  The tools comprising the toolkit range
from packet-crafting tools to send arbitrary Neighbor Discovery
packets to the most comprehensive IPv6 network scanning tool out
there (our scan6 tool).
