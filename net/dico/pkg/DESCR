GNU Dico is a flexible modular implementation of DICT server (RFC 2229).
In contrast to other implementations, it does not depend on a particular
database format. GNU Dico handles database accesses using loadable modules.

The package is shipped with quite a few modules that provide support for the
most often used database formats and strategies. New modules can easily be
written in C, Guile or Python. The module API is mature and well documented.

The package also includes a console client program that can be used to query
remote dictionary servers.
