| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Packet dissectors (here in Wireshark, and in other programs such as tcpdump)
have a long history of security problems. In Wireshark, these are isolated
from the packet capture code (which must have root privileges) by using a
separate program, dumpcap, to run the capture.

${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/dumpcap has been installed setuid root, with read/execute
access granted only to users in the _wireshark group. For normal interactive
use of Wireshark, add your username to this group:

  usermod -G _wireshark username

If you will only run Wireshark offline on files captured using tcpdump -w,
this step is not necessary.

DO NOT RUN WIRESHARK AS ROOT!
