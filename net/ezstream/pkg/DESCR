Ezstream is a command line source client for media streams, primarily
for streaming to Icecast servers.

It allows the creation of media streams in different formats based on
input from files or standard input that is piped through an optional
external de- and encoder. As every part of this chain is highly
configurable, ezstream can be useful in a large number of streaming
setups.
