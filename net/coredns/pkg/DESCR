CoreDNS is a DNS server/forwarder, written in Go, that chains plugins.
Each plugin performs a (DNS) function.

CoreDNS is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation graduated project.

CoreDNS is a fast and flexible DNS server. The key word here is flexible: with
CoreDNS you are able to do what you want with your DNS data by utilizing
plugins. If some functionality is not provided out of the box you can add it by
writing a plugin.

CoreDNS can listen for DNS requests coming in over UDP/TCP (go'old DNS), TLS
(RFC 7858), also called DoT, DNS over HTTP/2 - DoH - (RFC 8484) and gRPC (not a
standard).
