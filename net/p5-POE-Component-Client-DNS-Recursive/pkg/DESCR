POE::Component::Client::DNS::Recursive is a POE component that
implements a recursive DNS client.
POE sessions and components can spawn a
POE::Component::Client::DNS::Recursive instance to perform a DNS query.
The component will perform its task and return the results to the
requesting session.
One may also enable tracing of the delegation path from the root name
servers for the name being looked up.
