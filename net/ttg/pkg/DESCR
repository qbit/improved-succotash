TTG is a small command-line utility to display the throughput (bandwidth
usage) on an interface of a remote device such as a router, switch, etc.,
over SNMP.

Unlike tools like MRTG which sample bandwidth over a relatively long
interval (often 5 minutes), TTG is normally used to display throughput
over as little as one second.
