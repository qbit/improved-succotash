Due to the nature of this program, return packets from the target device
aren't usually sent to an address where PF can match them with a state
table entry for outgoing traffic, so with a typical "deny incoming"
ruleset, return packets from the device won't arrive.

You can add PF rules to permit the packets for MNDP and MAC-Telnet
respectively:

   pass proto udp from 0.0.0.0/32 port {5678 20561}

If using a multihomed system, mactelnet using the default setup with
ethernet broadcasts may not send packets via the correct interface.
Use the -n flag to send unicast packets instead (requires starting
mactelnet as root) to bypass this issue.
