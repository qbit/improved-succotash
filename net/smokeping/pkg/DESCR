SmokePing is a latency logging and interactive graphing system, for
ICMP pings and many other protocols (DNS, SSH, SIP, HTTP and more).
The main daemon process organizes latency measurements, records them
in an RRDtool database, and optionally sends email alerts based on
various criteria. The CGI/FastCGI program presents the graphs and
optionally allows remote control via a master/slave protocol (allowing
aggregation of data from multiple test locations in a single server).
