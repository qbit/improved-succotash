dnscrypt-proxy is a flexible DNS proxy with support for modern encrypted DNS
protocols, such as DNSCrypt v2 and DNS-over-HTTPS, and features:

- DNS traffic encryption and authentication. Supports DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) and
  DNSCrypt.
- DNS query monitoring with separate log files for regular and suspicious
  queries.
- Filtering: block ads, malware and other unwanted content. Compatible with all
  DNS services.
- Time-based filtering with a flexible weekly schedule.
- Transparent redirection of specific domains to specific resolvers.
- DNS caching to reduce latency and improve privacy.
- Local IPv6 blocking to reduce latency on IPv4-only networks.
- Load balancing: pick a set of resolvers, and dnscrypt-proxy will automatically
  measure their speeds in order to balance traffic among the fastest available.
- Cloaking: like a HOSTS file on steroids that can return preconfigured
  addresses for specific names or resolve and return the IP addresses of
  other names. This can be used for local development, as well as to
  enforce safe search results on Google, Yahoo and Bing.
- Automatic background updates of resolvers lists.
- Can force outgoing connections to use TCP.
- Supports SOCKS proxies.
- Compatible with DNSSEC.
