This package contains controller software for Ubiquiti UniFi access points,
switches, gateways and phones.

This package is from the 5.6 LTS branch, which continues to have support
for the Broadcom-based first generation of 802.11ac access points (UAP-AC,
UAP-ACv2, UAP-AC-Outdoor) and the Atheros-based but limited-memory
Picostation M2.

THIS BRANCH STOPPED RECEIVING SECURITY UPDATES IN NOVEMBER 2018 AND
SHOULD NOT BE USED UNLESS NECESSARY.

For other devices (including the older Atheros-based 802.11n access
points), see the other branches.
