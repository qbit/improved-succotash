ARouteServer is a Python tool to automatically build (and test)
configurations for BGP route servers.

Given YAML files providing general policies and clients' configuration
options, ARouteServer acquires external information to enrich them
(i.e. bgpq3 for IRR data, PeeringDB for max-prefix limit and AS-SETs)
and uses built-in Jinja2 templates to render configuration files for
route servers.

Currently it supports BIRD and OpenBGPd.
