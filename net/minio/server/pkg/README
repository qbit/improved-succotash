Fetching access/secret
======================

By default minio server runs as _minio user, and creates its configuration file
at first startup in ${VARBASE}/minio/export/.minio.sys/config/config.json. This
file contains the randomly generated accessKey and secretKey tokens that should
be used by minioc/S3-compatible clients to authenticate to the server.

Its API/web interface is accessible by default on port 9000, listening on all
network interfaces.

Bumping file limits
===================

Per https://github.com/minio/minio-service it is advised to run minio with more
file descriptors than what is allowed by the default daemon login class.

Add this to the login.conf(5) file if you want to bump those limits:

minio:\
	:openfiles-cur=4096:\
	:openfiles-max=8192:\
	:tc=daemon:

Refer to https://docs.minio.io/ for more details on how to run minio.
