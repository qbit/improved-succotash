Proxies incoming HTTP and TLS connections based on the hostname
contained in the initial request of the TCP session without decrypting
traffic. This enables HTTPS name-based virtual hosting to separate
backend servers without installing the private key on the proxy machine.

- Supports IPv4, IPv6 and Unix domain sockets for both back end
servers and listeners.

- Supports multiple listening sockets per instance.

- Supports HAProxy protocol to propagate original source address to
backend servers.
