Siphon is a collection of Python utilities for downloading data
from remote data services. Much of Siphon's current functionality
focuses on access to data hosted on a THREDDS Data Server
(https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/currents/tds/). It
also provides clients to a variety of simple web services.
