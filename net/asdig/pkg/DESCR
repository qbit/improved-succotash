asdig is a simple tool for retrieving ASN (autonomous system number)
match from IPv4/IPv6 published by services like Rezopole GoASMap
(http://github.com/rezopole/goasmap) or Cymru.

For a given IPv4 or IPv6 it would display current BGP anouncements
received at the BGP-infrastructure of the queried IP-to-AS reference
server, or Internet Exchange Point (IXP) subnets from PeeringDB,
or reserved subnets from Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
For a given AS number it would display a digest of the registered
informations from Regional Internet Registries (RIR).
