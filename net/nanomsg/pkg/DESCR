nanomsg is a socket library that provides several common communication
patterns. It aims to make the networking layer fast, scalable, and easy
to use.

The following scalability protocols are currently available:

    PAIR - simple one-to-one communication
    BUS - simple many-to-many communication
    REQREP - allows to build clusters of stateless services to process
    	     user requests
    PUBSUB - distributes messages to large sets of interested
    	     subscribers
    PIPELINE - aggregates messages from multiple sources and load
    	       balances them among many destinations
    SURVEY - allows to query state of multiple applications in one go
