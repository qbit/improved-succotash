| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD

This version of unison is compatible with:
- unison 2.52 or newer. You do not have to pay any attention to OCaml
  compiler versions.
- unison 2.51 if both versions are compiled with same OCaml compiler
  version.
- unison 2.48 if both versions are compiled with same OCaml compiler
  version.

It is possible to use the OPAM OCaml package manager to build unison
with the same version of the OCaml compiler on all machines:

doas pkg_add opam
export OPAMROOT=~/opam_unison
opam init --no-setup --compiler ocaml-base-compiler.4.09.0
opam install unison lablgtk  # To build without the gui, remove lablgtk
$(opam var bin)/unison

Common issue
=============
Unison sometimes reports chown() failures that are actually failures to
change group ownership. This can occur when a user does not belong to
the specified group and is the owner of the file, or is not the
superuser. Issue can be addressed by setting the option 'group' to
'false'.
