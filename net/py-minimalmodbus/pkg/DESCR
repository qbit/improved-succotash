MinimalModbus is an easy-to-use Python module for talking to
instruments (slaves) from a computer (master) using the Modbus
protocol, and is intended to be running on the master. Example code
includes drivers for Eurotherm and Omega process controllers. This
software supports the Modbus RTU and Modbus ASCII serial communication
versions of the protocol.
