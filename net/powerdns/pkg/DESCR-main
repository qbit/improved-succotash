The PowerDNS daemon is a versatile nameserver which supports a large number
of backends. These backends can either be plain zonefiles or be more dynamic
in nature. Additionally, through use of clever programming techniques,
PowerDNS offers very high domain resolution performance.

Backends for SQLite databases, BIND files and geographical load-balancing
are including in the main package. MySQL, PostgreSQL and LDAP back-ends are
packaged separately.
