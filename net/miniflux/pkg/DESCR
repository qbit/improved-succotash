Miniflux is a minimalist and opinionated feed reader:

- Written in Go (Golang)
- Works only with Postgresql
- Doesn't use any ORM
- Doesn't use any complicated framework
- Use only modern vanilla Javascript (ES6 and Fetch API)
- Single binary compiled statically without dependency
- The number of features is voluntarily limited
