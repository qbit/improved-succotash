DSVPN is a Dead Simple VPN, designed to address the most common use case
for using a VPN: client -> untrusted network -> vpn server -> the Internet

* Runs on TCP. Works pretty much everywhere, including on public WiFi
  where only TCP/443 is open or reliable.
* Uses only modern cryptography, with formally verified implementations.
* Low and constant memory footprint.
* Small (~25 KB), with an equally small and readable code base.
  No external dependencies.
* No configuration file. No post-configuration. Run a single-line command
  on the server, a similar one on the client and you're done. No firewall
  and routing rules to manually mess with.
* Works with Linux, MacOS and OpenBSD, as well as DragonFly BSD, FreeBSD
  and NetBSD in client and point-to-point modes.
* Doesn't leak between reconnects if the network doesn't change.
  Blocks IPv6 on the client to prevent IPv6 leaks.
