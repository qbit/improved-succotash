Snowflake is a pluggable transport that can be used for Tor,
usually for accessing the network when a user is on a connection
with only partial internet access.

It uses WebRTC negotiations for NAT traversal to connect to mostly
short-lived volunteer proxies. These proxies can either be provided
by running a web browser extension or a standalone proxy.

Users behind restrictive access can use snowflake as a bridge,
e.g. by configuring it in Tor Browser.

This package provides a proxy, for those who would like to use their
internet connection to provide access to others via this protocol.
