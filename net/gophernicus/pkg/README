| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

After installing the gophernicus package, edit /etc/inetd.conf and add
the following, all on one line:

gopher stream tcp nowait _gophernicus ${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/in.gophernicus	in.gophernicus -h "hostname" -nm -nu -nx

Replace "hostname" with the system's hostname. This should be valid
and resolvable, as it is used to construct links.

inetd(8) must then be enabled and started:

	# rcctl enable inetd
	# rcctl start inetd

By default, Gophernicus serves documents from ${VARBASE}/gopher and will
only serve files which are world-readable; being readable by the
server process is not enough.

For more information, see gophernicus(8) and
${TRUEPREFIX}/share/doc/gophernicus/README.md.
