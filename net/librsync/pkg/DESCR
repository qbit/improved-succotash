librsync implements the rolling-checksum algorithm of remote file
synchronization that was popularized by the rsync utility. This algorithm
transfers the differences between 2 files without needing both files on
the same system.

librsync is for building other programs that transfer files as efficiently
as rsync. You can use librsync in a program you write to do backups,
distribute binary patches to programs, or sync directories to a server
or between peers.

librsync does not implement the rsync wire protocol or network functions.

This tree also produces the rdiff command-line tool that exposes the key
operations of librsync: generating file signatures, generating the delta
from a signature to a new file, and applying the delta to regenerate the
new file given the old file.
