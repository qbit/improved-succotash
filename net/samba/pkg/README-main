| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration
=============
The configuration file, found at ${SYSCONFDIR}/samba/smb.conf can be used right
away for simple configurations.  Local users should be added to the
Samba user database using the pdbedit(1) utility in order to use the
Samba server.

# pdbedit -a -u <username>

Install the samba-docs package and see documentation files in
${PREFIX}/share/doc/samba and example config files in
${PREFIX}/share/examples/samba for more information.

Useful documentation is also available from the Samba wiki at

  https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Main_Page

Winbind
=======
Winbind on OpenBSD does not support local user logins as there
is no nsswitch support.  Winbind support is included for external
systems like Dovecot or Squid that are able to use it to authenticate
users.

AD DC support
=============
Support for AD DC mode is explicitely disabled in this port.  The AD DC
code is broken at runtime on several archs, and would need xattrs/ACLs
support to be truely usable.
