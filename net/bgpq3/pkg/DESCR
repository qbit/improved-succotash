The bgpq3 utility can be used to generate prefix-lists and other types
of filters for bgpd, BIRD, Cisco, Nokia SR-OS, Juniper Junos, and
other BGP implementations. Bgpq3 retrieves its input from IRRd servers.

Users of this might like to note that a fork, bgpq4 (which is faster
and aims to be better), also exists and is in packages.
