Matrix specifies a set of RESTful HTTP JSON APIs as an open standard for
federated Instant Messaging and VoIP (creating and managing distributed chat
rooms without points of control or failure, cryptographically secure state
synchronisation across an open network, etc).

In Matrix, every user runs one or more Matrix clients, which connect
through to a Matrix homeserver. The homeserver stores all their personal
chat history and user account information.

Synapse is a reference "homeserver" implementation of Matrix.
