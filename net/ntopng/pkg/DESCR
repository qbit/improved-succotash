ntopng is a network traffic probe that shows network usage in a high level
of detail. It provides a web-based UI allowing you to visualize traffic flows
broken down by host, country, port, application (via deep packet inspection),
AS number, etc. Flow information can also be dumped to ElasticSearch or
MySQL/MariaDB.
