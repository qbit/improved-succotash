Deadwood is the recursive DNS daemon (service) for MaraDNS 2.0.
MaraDNS 2.0 uses separate programs for authoritative records
(maradns) and recursive records (Deadwood). Deadwood is a
standalone recursive server that can either be used in
conjunction with MaraDNS's authoritative server, or by itself.
