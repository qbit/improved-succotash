The Python library for Arista's eAPI command API implementation provides
a client API work using eAPI and communicating with EOS nodes. The
Python library can be used to communicate with EOS either locally
(on-box) or remotely (off-box). It uses a standard INI-style
configuration file to specify one or more nodes and connection
properties.
