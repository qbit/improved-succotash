Get things from one computer to another, safely.

This package provides a library and a command-line tool named `wormhole`,
which makes it possible to get arbitrary-sized files and directories
(or short pieces of text) from one computer to another. The two endpoints are
identified by using identical "wormhole codes": in general, the sending
machine generates and displays the code, which must then be typed into the
receiving machine.

The codes are short and human-pronounceable, using a phonetically-distinct
wordlist. The receiving side offers tab-completion on the codewords, so
usually only a few characters must be typed. Wormhole codes are single-use
and do not need to be memorized.
