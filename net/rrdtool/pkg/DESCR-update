RRDtool is a high performance data logging and graphing system for time
series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature, server
load average, etc). RRDtool can be easily integrated in shell scripts,
perl, python, ruby, lua or tcl applications. It stores the data in a
very compact way that will not expand over time, and it presents useful
graphs by processing the data to enforce a certain data density.

This package includes the standalone rrdupdate/rrdinfo/rrdcreate tools,
which are packaged separately for those only needing to update RRDs
(but not draw graphs) without pulling in a big dependency chain.
