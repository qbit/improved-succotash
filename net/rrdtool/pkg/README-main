Use within a chroot jail
========================

Under OpenBSD, the default web server runs chrooted under /var/www.
To use the rrdtool(1) binary from within this chroot (for example, as
needed by some CGI/PHP scripts), rrdtool itself and several libraries
and configuration files must be copied in. The follow command has
been provided to do this for you:

    # ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/rrdtool/rrdtool-chroot enable

Note that you will have to run this command again when the rrdtool
package is updated.
