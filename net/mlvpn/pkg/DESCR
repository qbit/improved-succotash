MLVPN is VPN software that encrypts data with the Salsa20 stream cipher and
uses Poly1305 authentication. It can either run with a single ISP connection,
or can aggregate multiple circuits with active monitoring to identify and
remove faulty ones without dropping TCP connections. To avoid problems with
out-of-order packet delivery, it can optionally add delays per-connection
or buffer packets before delivering to the tun/tap interface.

MLVPN uses privilege separation and supports Linux, OpenBSD and FreeBSD.
