Dino is a modern open-source chat client for the desktop. It focuses on
providing a clean and reliable Jabber/XMPP experience while having your privacy
in mind.

Dino is secure by default: Your chats never leave your computer unencrypted.
Once you enabled end-to-end encryption via OMEMO or OpenPGP, only you and your
chat partners can read your messages, but not your server administrator or
anyone else.
