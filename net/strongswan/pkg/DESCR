strongSwan is reasonably portable open source VPN software supporting
both IKEv1 and IKEv2. It has wide support for authentication types
including IKEv1 XAUTH (username and password) and multiple IKEv2 EAP
mechanisms on both server and client side.

The OpenBSD port currently provides only the "kernel-libipsec" plugin.
This operates in userland via tun(4) devices and strongSwan's own
IPsec implementation rather than using kernel IPsec - it is suggested
that this is only used for testing or in client situations where the
native IPsec software (isakmpd and iked) does not support the required
functionality.
