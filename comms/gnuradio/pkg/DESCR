GNU Radio is a software development toolkit that provides signal processing
blocks to implement software radios. It can be used with readily-available
low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without
hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in hobbyist,
academic and commercial environments to support both wireless communications
research and real-world radio systems.

GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronisation elements, equalizers,
demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other elements (in the GNU Radio
jargon, we call these elements blocks) which are typically found in radio
systems. More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks
and then manages how data is passed from one block to another. Extending GNU
Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you
can quickly create and add it.

GNU Radio applications are primarily written using the Python programming
language, while the supplied, performance-critical signal processing path is
implemented in C++ using processor floating point extensions, where
available.
