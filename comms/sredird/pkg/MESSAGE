You may wish to add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf:

:2001 stream  tcp  nowait  root  ${PREFIX}/libexec/sredird \
	sredird 5 /dev/cua00 /var/spool/lock/LCK..cua00

which will start sredird on port 2001 and attach it to serial
port cua00.

inetd(8) must be reloaded (or started). To enable it at boot, the
following line needs to be added to rc.conf.local(5):
inetd_flags=
