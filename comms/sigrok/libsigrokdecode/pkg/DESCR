The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports
various device types (such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes,
multimeters, and more).

libsigrokdecode is a shared library written in C which provides the
basic API for running sigrok protocol decoders. The protocol decoders
themselves are written in Python.
