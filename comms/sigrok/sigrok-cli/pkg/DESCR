sigrok-cli is a command-line tool written in C, which uses both libsigrok
and libsigrokdecode to provide basic signal analysis functionality from the
command-line.

It cannot display graphical output, but is still sufficient to run through
the whole process of hardware initialization, acquisition, protocol decoding
and saving the session.

It is useful for running on remote or embedded systems, netbooks, PDAs, and
for various other use-cases. It can display samples on standard output or
save them in various file formats.
