The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports
various device types (such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes,
multimeters, and more).

fx2lafw is a Free/Libre/Open-source firmware for logic analyzers based
on the Cypress EZ-USB FX2(LP) chip.
