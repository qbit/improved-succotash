The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source logic analyzer software that supports various
logic analyzer hardware products.

libsigrok is a shared library written in C which provides the basic API
for talking to logic analyzer hardware and reading/writing the acquired
data into various input/output file formats.
