makeself is a shell script that generates a self-extractable tar.gz archive from
a directory. The resulting file appears as a shell script, and can be launched
as is. The archive will then uncompress itself to a temporary directory and an
arbitrary command will be executed (for example an installation script). This is
pretty similar to archives generated with WinZip Self-Extractor in the Windows
world.
