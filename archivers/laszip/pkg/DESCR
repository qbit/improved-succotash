LASzip quickly turns bulky LAS files into compact LAZ files without
information loss and is the de-facto standard for LiDAR compression.

LASzip compression can be many times smaller and many times faster than
generic compressors like bz2, gzip, and rar because it knows what the
different bytes in a LAS file represent. Another advantage of LASzip is
that it allows you to treat compressed LAZ files just like standard LAS
files. You can load them directly from compressed form into your
application without needing to decompress them onto disk first.
