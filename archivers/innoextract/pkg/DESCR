Inno Setup is a tool to create installers for Microsoft Windows
applications.  innoextract allows to extract such installers under
non-windows systems without running the actual installer using Wine.

innoextract is able to unpack GOG.com installers, Wadjet Eye Games
installers (to play with AGS), Arx Fatalis patches (for use with
Arx Libertatis) as well as various other Inno Setup executables.
