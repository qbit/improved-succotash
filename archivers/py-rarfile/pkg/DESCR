rarfile is a Python module for RAR archive reading. The interface
is made as zipfile like as possible.

Supports both RAR3 and RAR5 format archives, multi volume archives,
Unicode filenames, password-protected archives, archive and file
comments, and archive parsing and non-compressed files handled with
pure Python code, Compressed files are extracted by executing either
unrar from RARLAB or bsdtar from libarchive.  Works with both Python
2.7 and 3.x.
