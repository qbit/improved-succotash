Libarchive is a programming library that can create and read several different
streaming archive formats, including most popular tar variants, several cpio
formats, and both BSD and GNU ar variants. It can also write shar archives and
read ISO9660 CDROM images and ZIP archives.

bsdtar is an almost fully GNU tar-compatible frontend for libarchive.
It is one of the fastest tar implementations and supports many advanced
features not found elsewhere.
