This is the set of GNU shar utilities.

`gshar' makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing
them for transmission by electronic mail services.  `gunshar' helps
unpacking shell archives after reception.  The core of both programs
is initially derived from public domain.  Some modules and other
code sections are freely borrowed from other GNU distributions,
bringing `shar' under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
