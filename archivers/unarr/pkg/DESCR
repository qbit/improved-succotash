(lib)unarr is a decompression library for rar, tar, zip and 7z*
archives.

It was forked from unarr to provide a proper cmake based build system
suitable for packaging and cross-platform development, but its focus has
now been extended to provide code maintenance and to continue the
development of unarr, which is no longer mantained.
