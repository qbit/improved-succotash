A digital synthesis flow is a set of tools and methods used to turn a
VLSI design written in a high-level behavioral language like Verilog
or VHDL into a physical circuit, which can either be configuration code
for an FPGA target or a layout in a specific technology, that would
become part of an IC.
Qflow uses a complete and open source tool chain for synthesizing
digital circuits starting from Verilog source and ending in physical
layout for a specific target fabrication process.
