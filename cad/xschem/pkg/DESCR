Xschem is a schematic capture program, it allows creation of
hierarchical representation of circuits with a top down approach. By
focusing on interfaces, hierarchy and instance properties a complex
system can be described in terms of simpler building blocks.

A VHDL or Verilog or Spice netlist can be generated from the drawn
schematic, allowing the simulation of the circuit. Key feature of the
program is its drawing engine written in C and using directly the Xlib
drawing primitives; this gives very good speed performance, even on
very big circuits. The user interface is built with the Tcl-Tk
toolkit, tcl is also the extension language used.

Netlist can be exported in tEDAx format which can then be used by
pcb-rnd to design a printed circuit board.
