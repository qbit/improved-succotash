Magic is an interactive system for creating and modifying VLSI
circuit layouts. It is used to design basic cells and to combine
them hierarchically into large structures.

Magic understands quite a bit about the nature of circuits. It has
built-in knowledge of layout rules; during editing, it continuously
checks for rule violations. Magic also knows about connectivity and
transistors, and contains a built-in hierarchical circuit extractor.
It has a plow operation that permits to stretch or compact cells.
Lastly, Magic has routing tools to make the circuit interconnections.

Magic is based on the Mead-Conway style of design: it uses simplified
design rules and circuit structures that make it easier layout drawing
and permit Magic to provide powerful assistance, at the cost of
slightly less dense circuits.
