graywolf is a program for placement of VLSI digital circuits, mainly
intended as part of qflow tool-chain
(http://opencircuitdesign.com/qflow/).

It is a fork of the last open-source version of TimberWolf (which is now
commercial software) and has been modified to streamline the build
process and make it behave more as a standard command-line tool.

It is based on the general combinatorial optimization technique known as
simulated annealing and is suitable for standard cell, macro/custom
cell, and gate-array professional-grade placement.
