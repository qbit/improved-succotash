Skyfield computes positions for the stars, planets, and satellites in
orbit around the Earth. Its results should agree with the positions
generated by the United States Naval Observatory and their Astronomical
Almanac to within 0.0005 arcseconds (half a "mas" or milliarcsecond).

Skyfield can compute geocentric coordinates or topocentric coordinates
specific to your location on the Earth's surface.

While Skyfield itself has no dependency on the AstroPy library, it's
willing to accept AstroPy time objects as input and return results in
native AstroPy units.
