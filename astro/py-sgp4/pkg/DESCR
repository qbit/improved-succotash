This Python package computes the position and velocity of an
earth-orbiting satellite, given the satellite's TLE orbital elements
from a source like https://celestrak.com/.

It implements the most recent version of SGP4, and is regularly run
against the SGP4 test suite to make sure that its satellite position
predictions agree to within 0.1 mm with the predictions of the standard
distribution of the algorithm. This error is far less than the 1-3km/day
by which satellites themselves deviate from the ideal orbits described
in TLE files.
