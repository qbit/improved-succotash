This package can load and use a Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)
ephemeris for predicting the position and velocity of a planet or other
Solar System body.

Note that jplephem offers only the logic necessary to produce plain
three-dimensional vectors. Most programmers interested in astronomy
will want to look at Skyfield instead, which uses jplephem but converts
the numbers into more traditional measurements like right ascension and
declination.

Most users will use jplephem with the Satellite Planet Kernel (SPK)
files that the NAIF facility at NASA JPL offers for use with their own
SPICE toolkit. They have collected their most useful kernels beneath the
directory: http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/
