Running plan9port binaries
==========================
The plan9port tools consist of many small binaries intimately tied
together, some of them conflicting with OpenBSD base utilities. To
avoid runtime conflicts, you may wish to append
${TRUEPREFIX}/plan9/bin to your PATH.

Alternatively, plan9port tools can be run with ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/9

9 man 1 intro

Reading plan9port manual pages
==============================
You may add the plan9/man directory to man.conf(5) or set

export MANPATH=:${TRUEPREFIX}/plan9/man

in the shell where you want to read plan9port manuals. Note the
leading colon.
