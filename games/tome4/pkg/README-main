| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have troubles running the game, you can try --safe-mode
parameter. The full list of available parameters can be found on the
project's wiki: https://te4.org/wiki/Command_Line_Arguments

-Mmodule	Automatically load and run module instead of going to the boot menu
-uname		Use name for the character name instead of prompting,
		and either load that character's saved game or create a new game
		with that name.
-n		Force creating a new game, overwriting any previous saved game
		for the given character name
-Eargs		Passes extra arguments to the game module (?)
--xpos		x Create the game window at the given X coordinate
--ypos		y Create the game window at the given Y coordinate
--flushâ€‘stdout	Write to te4_log.txt immediately instead of buffering output.
		This facilitates debugging but can slow T-Engine4 down.
--no-debug	Disables most output to te4_log.txt
--safe-mode	Disables many graphical effects and reverts to minimal screen
		size and graphics settings
--home path	Use the given directory instead of your default operating
		system home directory. T-Engine's settings and saved games will
		be saved in a subdirectory under this home directory, as
		described here. For example, this can be used to set up a
		separate directory for developing modules, with cheat enabled
		and with less "stuff" so it loads faster, without interfering
		with your regular ToME saved games.
