Inform 6 is an object-oriented language for writing interactive fiction,
also known as "text adventures" or "adventure games".

As an interactive fiction developer, you create Inform 6 source code
defining the story. Then compile from source code to a "story file".
The resulting story files are highly portable, with interpreters
available for many different platforms.

This package contains the Inform 6 standard library.
