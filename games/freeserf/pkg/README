FreeSerf
========
FreeSerf requires the original game files from The Settlers or Serf City
to function properly.  These can come from the original disks or
installation, either the DOS or Amiga version.

The DOS data file is called SPAE.PA, SPAD.PA, SPAF.PA, or SPAU.PA,
depending on the language of the game. The Amiga data files are called
gfxheader, gsxfast, gfxchip, gfxpics, sounds, and music.

If the DOS data file is lowercase (e.g. spau.pa), then it must be
renamed to all capital letters.

The files must be placed in ~/.local/share/freeserf or the current
working directory.

It is important, if using the DOS version, to copy the file from an
actual installation and not directly from the disk. The file on disk is
compressed, and will not work with FreeSerf.
