Obtaining FNA games for OpenBSD
===============================

Obtain the Linux version of the game and extract it, usually simply with the
unzip package, even if there is no filename extension or the extension is .sh
as with GOG.com or HumbleBundle games.

Running FNA games
=================

Enter directory of the game where FNA.dll is located. Run:

$ fnaify

in that directory. If everything works as expected, it will tell you how to run
the game at the end of the script; typically by invoking the launch script.
