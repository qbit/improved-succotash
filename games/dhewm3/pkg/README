| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To play Doom3 on OpenBSD, you need the original game, patched to
version 1.3.1.  Copy the game data (pak000-8.pk4) to ~/.config/dhewm3/base
or ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/dhewm3/base (system-wide) and place your CD
key in a file called ~/.config/dhewm3/base/doomkey or
${TRUEPREFIX}/share/dhewm3/base/doomkey respectively.

Please note that some users will need to set the following environment
variable to fix erratic mouse behaviour on their system :

	export SDL_VIDEO_X11_DGAMOUSE=0
