Red Eclipse is a single-player and multi-player first-person
ego-shooter, built as a total conversion of Cube Engine 2,
which lends itself toward a balanced gameplay, completely at
the control of map makers, while maintaining a general theme
of agility in a variety of environments.

This package contains the client and server binaries.
