GNU Robbo is a free open source reimplementation of Janusz Pelc's
Robbo for the Atari XE/XL which was distributed by LK Avalon in 1989.

Robbo is stranded on an inhospitable planet. Help him to escape by
collecting the parts to repair his capsule whilst avoiding the deadly
animals, guns, bombs, lasers and other unpleasant things.
