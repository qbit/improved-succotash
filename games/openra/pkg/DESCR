OpenRA is a project that recreates and modernizes the classic Command & Conquer
real time strategy games. The OpenRA engine provides a common platform for
rebuilding and reimagining classic 2D and 2.5D RTS games (the OpenRA mods).

It includes native support for modern operating systems and screen resolutions
without relying on emulation or binary hacks, and features integrated online
multiplayer.

OpenRA is 100% free, and comes bundled with three distinct mods. When you run a
mod for the first time the game can automatically download the original game
assets, or you can use the original game disks.

Features include:
* A choice between right click and classic left click control schemes
* Overhauled sidebar interfaces for managing production
* Support for game replays and an observer interface designed for streaming
  games online
* The fog of war that obscures the battlefield outside your units' line of sight
* Civilian structures that can be captured for strategic advantage
* Units gain experience as they fight and improve when they earn new ranks
