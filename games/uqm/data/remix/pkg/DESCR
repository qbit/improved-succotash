In 2002, the Precursors--a group of musicians--decided to remix the
soundtrack of Star Control 2, in response to the game's open-source
release as The Ur-Quan Masters. The resulting soundtrack consists of
four music packs: Super Melee!, Neutral Aliens, Don't Shoot!, The
Ur-Quan Hierarchy, and The New Alliance of Free Stars.
