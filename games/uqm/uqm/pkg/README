Documentation
=============

uqm has a manpage:

$ man 6 uqm

Read it! It describes the controls and gameplay, and provides extensive
background to the game's story.

Additional narrative is provided when you start a new game--so long as
you don't accidentally skip it by pressing a button.

Addons
======

Three packages add optional data content to the game. If no content
packages are installed, uqm provides the "vanilla" experience: music
from the MS-DOS version of the game, and no voices.

uqm-threedomusic
----------------
This package provides the music from the 3DO release of the game.
It can be turned on by enabling "3DO Remixes" in the audio options.

uqm-voices
----------
This package provides the voices from the 3DO release of the game.
It is configured with the "Speech Volume" setting in the audio options.

uqm-remix
---------
This package provides the music from the Precursors fan remix project.
It can be turned on by enabling "UQM Remixes" in the audio options.
