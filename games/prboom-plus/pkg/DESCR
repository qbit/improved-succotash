Modified PrBoom port with uncapped framerate, variable gamespeed,
re-record, walkcam, chasecam, full mouselook, fov and other features
without loss of compatibility with original DOOM.

Not intended to replace the prboom package, this port has additional
features particularly interesting to fans of demo recording/playback.

A registered IWAD from one of the original Doom games may be placed in
${PREFIX}/share/doom/.

Music is available with the timidity package.
