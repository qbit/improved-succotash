OpenRCT2
========
OpenRCT2 requires the original game files from RollerCoaster Tycoon 2
to work properly.  These can come from an original CD or from GOG.com.

If using the GOG.com version, you must extract the files from
setup_rollercoaster_tycoon_2.exe using the innoextract package. The
files will be in a directory named app. You must keep this directory,
though it can be renamed and moved to a location of your choosing, and
you can delete everything else that is extracted from the exe, such as
the tmp directory. You must edit the game_path variable in
~/.config/OpenRCT2/config.ini to point to this directory. You must use
the full path.

If you have a copy of the original RollerCoaster Tycoon, you can use
its data files as well to play the original game. If using the GOG.com
version, RollerCoaster Tycoon Deluxe, follow the same steps as above
with setup_rollercoaster_tycoon_deluxe.exe and edit rct1_path in
~/.config/OpenRCT2/config.ini to point to this directory.
