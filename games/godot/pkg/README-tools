Modules
=======

Note that this version includes the module "GodotSteam" in its namespace which
is not part of the default Godot install. This is mainly for compatibility with
runtime of prepackaged games. It communicates with games/goldberg_emulator, not
an official Steam client. Making use of the Steam.* namespace for development
may lead to unexpected behavior, so use at your own risk.
