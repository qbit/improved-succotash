OpenFodder
==========
OpenFodder requires the original game files from Cannon Fodder to work
properly.  These can come from an original CD or from GOG.com.

If using the GOG.com version, you must extract the files from
setup_cannon_fodder_2.0.0.3.exe using the innoextract package. The
files will be in a directory named app. You must copy the CF_ENG.DAT
file from the app directory to ~/.local/share/OpenFodder/Data/Dos_CD
for the game to work. Additionally, you must copy the
${TRUEPREFIX}/share/OpenFodder/Campaigns directory to the
~/.local/share/OpenFodder directory. Finally, a Saves directory should
be created.

The easiest way to do this is to follow these steps:
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/OpenFodder/Data/Dos_CD
$ innoextract setup_cannon_fodder_2.0.0.3.exe
$ cp app/CD_ENG.DAT ~/.local/share/OpenFodder/Data/Dos_CD
$ cp -R ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/OpenFodder/Campaigns ~/.local/share/OpenFodder
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/OpenFodder/Saves

You may then delete everything else extracted from the exe.

If you would like a global installation of the game files, copy the
CF_ENG.DAT file to ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/OpenFodder/Data/Dos_CD instead.

If you have the Amiga version, please see
${TRUEPREFIX}/share/doc/openfodder/README.md for instructions on where
to put the data files.
