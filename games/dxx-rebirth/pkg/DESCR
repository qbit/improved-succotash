DXX-Rebirth is a Source Port of the Descent and Descent 2 Engines,
offering OpenGL graphics and effects, advanced Multiplayer, many
improvements and new features.

Do you like getting disoriented flying through narrow corridors while
getting fired at from 6 degrees of freedom? Enjoy looking at confusing
maps that look like yarn after your cats played with it? Love blowing up
reactors that shoot red balls at you, only to get lost trying to find
the exit afterwards and getting blown up with the entire mine? If this
sounds fun to you, you have probably played Descent 1 or 2.
