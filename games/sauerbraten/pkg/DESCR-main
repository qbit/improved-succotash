Cube 2: Sauerbraten is a free multiplayer/singleplayer first person
shooter, built as a major redesign of the Cube FPS.

Much like the original Cube, the aim of this game is not necessarily
to produce the most features & eyecandy possible, but rather to allow
map/geometry editing to be done dynamically in-game, to create fun
gameplay and an elegant engine. 

This package contains the client and server binaries.
