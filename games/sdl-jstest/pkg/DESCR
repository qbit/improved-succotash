sdl-jstest and sdl2-jstest are simple programs that let you find out how
many joysticks SDL or SDL2 detected on your system, how many axes,
buttons, hats and balls they have each. They also lets you test the
joysticks by displaying the events they send or by displaying their
current button, axis, hat or ball state. sdl-jstest is especially useful
if you want to test your SDL_LINUX_JOYSTICK configuration.
