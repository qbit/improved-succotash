Galois is a computer game of the "falling blocks" type, but with unique
features. Unlike most other games of that type, Galois is not limited to
blocks made of four two-dimensional square bricks: you can choose among
several different brick shapes, blocks composed of more or less bricks,
and even between two- and three-dimensional games.
