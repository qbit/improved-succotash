CuteMaze is a simple, top-down game in which mazes are randomly
generated using one of a choice of several different algorithms. You
move the character through the maze while hunting for targets (cheese,
by default)-the game is won once all of these targets have been picked
up.

Features:
* Showing the amount of time and steps it has taken to play the maze
* "Bread crumb" trail to show you where you've already been (optional)
* Flag system which allows you to mark and later un-mark any square on
  the board
* Hints that direct you to the closest target
* Zooming out to see more of the maze
* SVG themes (two themes come with the game)
