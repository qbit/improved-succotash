Steam emulator that emulates steam online features. Lets you play games that use
the steam multiplayer apis on a LAN without steam or an internet connection.

How to use:

Replace the steam_api(64).dll (libsteam_api.so on linux) from the game with
mine. For linux make sure that if the original api is 32 bit you use a 32 bit
build and if it's 64 bit you use a 64 bit build.

Put a steam_appid.txt file that contains the appid of the game right beside it
if there isn't one already.
