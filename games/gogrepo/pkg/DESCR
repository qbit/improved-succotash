Python-based tool for downloading your GOG.com game collections and extras to
your local computer for full offline enjoyment.

By default, game folders are saved in the same location that the script is run
in. You can also specify another directory. Run gogrepo.py -h to see help or
read more below. Each game has its own directories with all game/bonus files
saved within.

Features:

* Ability to choose which games to download based on combinations of OS
(windows, linux, mac) and language (en, fr, de, etc...)

* Saves a !info.txt in each game folder with information about each game/extra
item.

* Creates a !serial.txt if the game has a special serial/cdkey (I know, not 100%
DRM-free, is it?). Sometimes coupon codes are hidden here!

* Verify your downloaded collection with full MD5, zip integrity, and expected
file size checking.

* Auto retrying of failed fetch/downloads. Sometime GOG servers report temporary
errors.

* Ability to import your already existing local collection.

* Easy to throw into a daily cronjob to get all the latest updates and newly
added content!

* Clear logging prints showing update/download progress and HTTP errors. Easy to
pipe or tee to create a log file.
