julius
======
julius requires the original game files from Caesar III to work
properly.  These can come from an original CD or from GOG.com.

If using the GOG.com version, you must extract the files from
setup_caesar3_2.0.0.9.exe using the innoextract package. The files will
will be in a directory named app. You must keep this directory, though
it can be renamed and moved to a location of your choosing, and you can
delete everything else that is extracted from the exe, such as the tmp
directory.

The game can by run in two ways. First, it can be run from the app
directory itself, such as the following:
$ innoextract setup_caesar3_2.0.0.9.exe
$ cd app
$ julius

Or, it can be run as:
$ julius /path/to/app/

Note that in either case, save files will be saved to the app directory
so you must have write access to it.
