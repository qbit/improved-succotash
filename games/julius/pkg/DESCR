julius is an open source re-implementation of the Caesar III game
engine.

In Caesar III, players take on the role of a Roman governor, tasked with
building up a grand Roman city, in which they must ensure their citizens
have their needs met, that their city is safe and profitable, while
meeting various goals set for them and dealing with various disasters,
angry gods and hostile enemies.

While this package and the game engine are open source, one still needs
to provide the original game assets from Caesar III, which is not open
source. You will need to purchase the original game to use this package.
