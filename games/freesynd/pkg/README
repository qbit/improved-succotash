freesynd
========
FreeSynd requires the original game files from Syndicate to work
properly.  These must be the original game, not Syndicate Plus.

While freesynd is a game engine and is open source software, Syndicate
is proprietary software and must be purchased in order for FreeSynd to
work.

The game files (under DATA) as well as intro.xmi and syngame.xmi must
be placed in ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/freesynd/data
