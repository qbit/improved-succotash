| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the game you need the original Quake 1 data files
(must be purchased with the game):

1) Create a directory called quake

2) Under the 'quake' directory create the 'id1' directory

3) Copy the original Quake 1 files into that id1 directory.
   These files are usually pak0.pak, pak1.pak and files under 'glquake'.
   If files are uppercase, they must be renamed to lowercase.

4) Run 'ezquake' from the quake directory you created in step 1.
