Return to the Roots
===================
Return to the Roots requires the original game files from The Settlers 2
Gold Edition to work properly.  These can come from an original CD or
from GOG.com.

If using the GOG.com version, you must extract the files from
setup_settlers2_gold_2.0.0.14.exe using the innoextract package. The
files will be in a directory named app. You must copy the contents of
the app directory to the ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/s25rttr/S2/ directory.

The easiest way to do this is to execute the following:
$ doas cp -R app/* ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/s25rttr/S2

You can then delete everything extracted from the exe, such as the tmp
directory.

While returntotheroots is open source, The Settlers 2: Gold Edition is
not. You will need to purchase the game in order to use this package.
