Run tdm_update before the first start
=====================================

In order to play missions, you need to download the base game assets. The
package contains only the runtime (thedarkmod) and the game data updater
(tdm_update). Before you launch the game the first time, run

$ tdm_update

to install the base game data in ~/.local/share/thedarkmod. Note that the base
game data requires about 3.5G of free space on your home partition. If you want
to update the game data later to the most recent version, run tdm_updater again.

Launch the game with thedarkmod
===============================

After installation of the base game data, run the game with

$ thedarkmod

The core configuration of the game is in

~/.local/share/thedarkmod/Darkmod.cfg

The game has been noticed to not display fullscreen mode properly. In that
case, change r_fullscreen to "0".
