A dark and moody stealth game, inspired by the "Thief" series by
Looking Glass Studios, The Dark Mod includes creative new gameplay
features, dozens of unique AI, and a complete set of custom art
assets, allowing players and mappers alike to enjoy missions in a
gothic steampunk universe. When you play The Dark Mod, you feel
like you're playing a gothic stealth game...

This game is first and foremost a toolkit, allowing fans and
team-members to create their own stealth missions in a gothic
steampunk environment. But there are already over 100 full missions
for download, including some small campaigns, so it certainly feels
like a game. The only difference is that you have to choose which
missions to install and play.
