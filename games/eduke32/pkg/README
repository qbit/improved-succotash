Shareware Duke Nukem 3D data has been installed to:
  ${PREFIX}/share/duke3d/

You may also copy your registered version data files, or any other
Duke Nukem 3D retail copies (such as the Atomic Edition) or Ion Fury game
files to a local directory such as ~/duke3d/, and run eduke32 from within
that directory:

  % cd ~/duke3d/ && eduke32

This will load your registered version data rather than the installed
shareware.

eduke32 includes a map editor, mapster32, which is an up-to-date
version of Ken Silverman's BUILD editor, including changes necessary
to impliment the advanced mapping/modding functions of eduke32.

Sample maps, defs and con files can be used to show how to create your
own maps and modifications, if you are so inclined. They are located in
${PREFIX}/share/examples/eduke32/

Licenses are found under ${PREFIX}/share/doc/eduke32/

https://wiki.eduke32.com contains a large resource of information on
how to make full use of the eduke32 engine and mapster32 editor.
