Postal
======
Postal requires the original game files from Postal 1 to work properly.
These can come from an original CD or from GOG.com.

If using the GOG.com version, you must extract the files from the Linux
version of the game, named gog_postal_classic_and_uncut_2.1.0.3.sh or
something similar, using the unzip package.

The game data is in the data/noarch/game directory that is created.

The game will only run if the data/noarch/game directory is your
current working directory.

Quick setup:
$ unzip gog_postal_classic_and_uncut_2.1.0.3.sh
$ cd data/noarch/game
$ postal1

To go to the next level, press F1 after completing your objective.
