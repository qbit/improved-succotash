CorsixTH is a reimplementation of the 1997 Bullfrog business sim Theme
Hospital. As well as faithfully recreating the original, CorsixTH adds
support for modern operating systems, high resolutions, and much more.

CorsixTH requires game assets from Theme Hospital to work properly.

CorsixTH is only the game engine. While CorsixTH is open source
software, Theme Hospital is proprietary software and must be purchased.
