CorsixTH
========
CorsixTH requires the original game files from Theme Hospital to work
properly.  These can come from an original CD or from GOG.com.

While CorsixTH is a game engine and is open source software, Theme
Hospital is proprietary software and must be purchased in order for
CorsixTH to work.

CorsixTH will ask you for the location of the game files on first
launch. Point CorsixTH to the directory on your hard drive containing
these files.

If using the GOG.com version, you must extract the files from
setup_theme_hospital_2.1.0.8.exe using the innoextract package. The
files will be in a directory named app. You must keep this directory,
though it can be renamed and moved to a location of your choosing, and
you can delete everything else that is extracted from the exe, such as
the tmp directory.
