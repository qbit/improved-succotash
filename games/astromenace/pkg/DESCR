Space is a vast area, an unbounded territory where it seems there is a
room for everybody, but reversal of fortune put things differently. The
hordes of hostile creatures crawled out from the dark corners of the
universe, craving to conquer your homeland. Their force is compelling,
their legions are interminable. However, humans didn't give up without a
final showdown and put their best pilot to fight back. These malicious
invaders chose the wrong galaxy to conquer and you are to prove it! Go
ahead and make alien aggressors regret their insolence.

AstroMenace is a vertical space shoot-em-up with 3D graphics featuring
customizable ships.
