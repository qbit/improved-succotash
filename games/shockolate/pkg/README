Installing Game Assets
======================

${PKGSTEM} requires the assets from the classic CD-ROM version of the game from
1994. The Enhanced Edition content is not supported at this point.

After locating the files, copy the game's DATA and SOUND directories into
~/.local/share/shockolate/res. Here is an example based on the System Shock:
Classic Edition from GOG.com (use innoextract from packages):

$ innoextract setup_system_shock_classic_2.0.0.3.exe
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/shockolate/res
$ cp -R app/SSHOCK/{DATA,SOUND} ~/.local/share/shockolate/res/
$ systemshock

Note that the wrapper script will automatically lowercase all files and
directories in ~/.local/share/shockolate/res.

Using Soundfonts for Better Audio
=================================

${PKGSTEM} can use sound fonts via fluidsynth as alternative to the rather
basic MIDI soundtrack. For easy setup, install the package
audio/generaluser-gs-soundfont and select FluidSynth in the in-game menu (Esc ->
Audio -> Audio Options).

Other sound fonts can be install by dropping a .sf2 sound font file into
~/.local/share/shockolate/res/.
