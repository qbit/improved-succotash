GNU FreeDink is a new and portable version of the game engine, which
runs the original game as well as its D-Mods, with close compatibility,
under multiple platforms.

It also comes with the DFArc front-end to manage and play Dink Modules
(or D-Mods for short): fans-made new add-ons, some of them bigger than
the original game!

And if you want to make your own adventure, the FreeDinkedit game editor
awaits you.
