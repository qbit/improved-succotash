devilutionx
===========
devilutionx requires the original game files from Diablo I to work
properly.  These can come from an original CD or from GOG.com.

You must place the file diabdat.mpq in
~/.local/share/diasurgical/devilution/
If the file is uppercase (i.e. DIABDAT.MPQ), you must rename it to
all lowercase.

While this package and the game engine are open source, one still needs
to provide the original game assets from Diablo I, which is not open
source. You will need to purchase the original game to use this package.

Multiplayer may not work on 64-bit platforms. This is known upstream.
