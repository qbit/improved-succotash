DevilutionX is an open source recreation of the game engine used in
Diablo I, an action role-playing game by Blizzard Entertainment.

While this package and the game engine are open source, one still needs
to provide the original game assets from Diablo I, which is not open
source. You will need to purchase the original game to use this package.
