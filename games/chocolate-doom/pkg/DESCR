Chocolate Doom is an SDL-based port of the classic DOOM.EXE experience from
the days of DOS.  The project aims to provide an experience identical to that
of the original games on original hardware.  A game configuration program is 
included, and emulates the classic DOS-style SETUP.EXE of the originals.

The project also maintains versions of the engine for Heretic, Hexen, and
Strife.  All original game PWADs and demos should work flawlessly.
