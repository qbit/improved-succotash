Remote Play client registration
===============================

If your PS4/PS5 Console is on the same layer 2 network segment, is
turned on or in stand-by mode, and does not have Discovery explicitly
disabled, then Chiaki should find it.

Otherwise, you can add it manually. To do so, click the "+" icon in
the top right, and enter your console's IP address.

You will then need to register your console with Chiaki.
Two pieces of information are required to do this:

Obtaining your PSN AccountID
-----------------------------

Starting with PS4 firmware 7.0, it is necessary to use a so-called
"AccountID" as opposed to the "Online-ID" for registration.

This ID seems to be a unique identifier for a PSN Account and it can
be obtained from the PlayStation Network after logging in using OAuth.
A Python script which does this is provided here:
  ${LOCALBASE}/share/examples/chiaki/psn-account-id.py
Simply run it in a terminal and follow the instructions. Once you know
the ID, write it down. You will likely not have to repeat this process.

Obtaining a Registration PIN
-----------------------------

The console must be put into registration mode in order to allow
Chiaki to register as a remote play client.

To do this on a PS4, go to:
Settings -> Remote Play -> Add Device
Alternatively, on a PS5:
Settings -> System -> Remote Play -> Link Device

The console will now wait for new Remote Play clients to connect.

Starting Remote Play
--------------------

Double-click your console's entry in Chiaki's main window to start
Remote Play.

Key Bindings
============

Key bindings can be reviewed and changed in Chiaki's settings dialog.
The F11 key is an undocumented and hard-coded fullscreen toggle.

Controllers
===========

PlayStation controllers attach as ujoy(4). Chiaki recognizes official
Sony controllers based on a hard-coded list of SDL controller IDs.
The upside is that no controller button configuration is required.
The downside is that PlayStation-compatible third-pary controllers
might not work even if they work with the console.
