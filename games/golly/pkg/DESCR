Game of Life simulator using hashlife algorithm

Golly simulates Conway's Game of Life with an arbitrarily large grid of
cells.  It can optionally use a hashlife algorithm, which allows it to
rapidly compute generations for huge patterns, and to compute many
generations into the future at a time.

Golly provides a graphical interface for viewing and editing cellular
automata.  It supports copy and paste, zoom, auto-fit, multiple layers,
and viewing different areas of a pattern simultaneously in different
areas of a window.
