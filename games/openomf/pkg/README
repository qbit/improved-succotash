OpenOMF
=======
OpenOMF requires the original game files from One Must Fall 2097 in
order to work properly. While OpenOMF is open source software, One Must
Fall 2097 is proprietary and must be obtained in order to use OpenOMF.

Fortunately, the developers of One Must Fall 2097 released the game as
freeware in 1999. It is available for download at archive.org:
https://archive.org/download/OneMustFall2097/OMF21cd-playable.ZIP
The above zip file has the following checksum:
SHA256 (OMF21cd-playable.ZIP) = pZ4Ke4NMfyNANwwGXkiuSjsnWzdw91uNGl3YrYi5inQ=

Note that this .ZIP file will extract its contents into the working
directory!

For a global installation, the game files must be placed in
${TRUEPREFIX}/share/openomf.

Alternatively, the game can be launched from any directory that holds
the game assets. If you choose this route, the file
${TRUEPREFIX}/share/openomf/openomf.bf must be copied to this
directory before launching the game.
