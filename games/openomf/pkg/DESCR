OpenOMF is a Open Source remake of "One Must Fall 2097" by Diversions
Entertainment. Together with networking support, OpenOMF tries to make
it easier to play One Must Fall in its original glory on multiple
platforms.

Project goals:
* At first, as faithful a game binary to the original as possible.
* Better game controller support (new gamepads etc.)
* Better networking support. The original game used IPX/SPX networking.
* More network game types. For example full Internet tournaments are
  being planned.
* Support for new graphics and audio. The current version of OpenOMF
  already supports loading alternate music files. Support for alternate
  sprites is coming after the game is otherwise working okay.
* Enhanced tournament mode!

While OpenOMF is open source, the game and its assets are not.
Fortunately, the developers released the game as freeware in 1999. It
