Yamagi Quake II is an enhanced client for id Software's Quake II. The
main focus is an unchanged single player experience like back in 1997,
thus the gameplay and the graphics are unaltered. Over 1000 bugs were
fixed and an extensive code audit done, making Yamagi Quake II one of
the most solid Quake II implementations available. Other than most ports
Yamagi Quake II is full 64 bit clean, so it works perfectly on modern 64
bit processors and operating systems.
