dopewars is a game simulating the life of a drug dealer in 1984 New
York, based upon the MS-DOS game of the same name, in turn derived
from "Drug Wars" by John E. Dell. The aim of the game is to make
lots and lots of money, but unfortunately you start the game with
a hefty debt to the loan shark (who charges equally hefty interest)
and the cops take a rather dim view of drug dealing...

dopewars expands upon the MS-DOS version by introducing multiplayer
functions. With the aid of dopewars servers, several players (computer
or human) can roam New York (or some other city, chosen by the
operator of the server) and attempt to shoot other players and steal
their lucrative drugs.
