OpenJazz
========
OpenJazz requires the original game files from Jazz Jackrabbit to work
properly.  These can come from an original CD or from GOG.com.

If using the GOG.com version, you must extract the files from
setup_jazz_jackrabbit_collection_2.0_cs_(28162).exe using the
innoextract package.

The files will be in a directory named app. You must keep this
directory, though it can be renamed and moved to a location of your
choosing. You can delete everything else that is extracted from the exe.

While this package and the game engine are open source, one still needs
to provide the original game assets from Jazz Jackrabbit, which is not
open source. You will need to purchase the original game to use this
package.
