_Race for the galaxy_ is a popular card game by Tom Lehmann, 
distributed by Rio Grande Games in the US and Ystari in France. 
So far, with five extensions.
 
This program allows you to play against an AI, with or without the
first 3 extensions, and with partial support for the 4th one (cards
from Alien Encounter, but not the new rules), and no support yet for
the 5th one, Xeno.
