vile is a text editor which is extremely compatible with vi in terms
of "finger feel".  In addition, it has extended capabilities in many areas,
notably multi-file editing and viewing, key rebinding, real X window
system support, an optional embedded perl interpreter, and robust
support for non-Unix hosts.

The authors of vile are Paul Fox, Tom Dickey, and Kevin Buettner.

Many patches have been contributed by a lot of users.  We thank them.
