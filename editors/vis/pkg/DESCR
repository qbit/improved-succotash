Vis aims to be a modern, legacy free, simple yet efficient editor combining the
strengths of both vi(m) and sam.

It extends vi's modal editing with built-in support for multiple
cursors/selections and combines it with sam's structural regular expression
based command language.

As an universal editor it has decent Unicode support and should cope with
arbitrary files including: large, binary or single-line ones.

Efficient syntax highlighting is provided using Parsing Expression Grammars
which can be conveniently expressed using Lua in the form of LPeg.
