Micro is a terminal-based text editor that aims to be easy to use and
intuitive, while also taking advantage of the full capabilities of modern
terminals.

As the name indicates, micro aims to be somewhat of a successor to the nano
editor by being easy to install and use in a pinch, but micro also aims to be
enjoyable to use full time, whether you work in the terminal because you
prefer it, or because you need to.
