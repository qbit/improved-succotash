D-Bus possible issues
=====================
You may experience a bug in graphical Emacs sessions (freeze/crash at
exit time).  Ensuring you have a D-Bus user session started should fix
this.  See the D-Bus pkg-readme.

Dired and ls(1)
===============
Dired attempts to use the --dired GNU ls(1) switch, which OpenBSD ls(1)
doesn't support.  Read info '(emacs) Dired Enter' and
'(emacs) ls in Lisp'.  GNU ls is available in the coreutils package.
