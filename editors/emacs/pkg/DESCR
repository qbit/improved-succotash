GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editor - and more. At its
core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp
programming language with extensions to support text editing. The
features of GNU Emacs include:

  - Content-sensitive editing modes, including syntax coloring, for a
    variety of file types including plain text, source code, and HTML.
  - Complete built-in documentation, including a tutorial for new
    users.
  - Full Unicode support for nearly all human languages and their
    scripts.
  - Highly customizable, using Emacs Lisp code or a graphical
    interface.
  - A large number of extensions that add other functionality,
    including a project planner, mail and news reader, debugger
    interface, calendar, and more. Many of these extensions are
    distributed with GNU Emacs; others are available separately.

This package now includes the Elisp source files previously available in
the emacs-el package.
