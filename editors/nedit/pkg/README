Due to a conflict with nc(1), the NEdit Client program, originally
called nc, has been installed as ncl.

Additional patterns for NEdit have been installed under:
    ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/nedit/patterns/

To load them into NEdit, run the following command:
    $ nedit -import PATTERN_FILE.pats

The patterns can then be saved permanently into nedit's own resource
file by using "Save Defaults" from the "Preferences" menu.
