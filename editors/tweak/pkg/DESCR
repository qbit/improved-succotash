Tweak is an ncurses-based hex editor. Tweak uses a complex data structure
based on B-trees, designed to make almost all editing operations extremely
fast, even when they are working on huge amounts of data. Unlike most hex
editors, it also has a fully functional insert mode, along with full cut,
copy, and paste support.
