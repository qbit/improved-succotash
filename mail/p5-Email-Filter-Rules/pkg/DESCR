Email::Filter::Rules is a simple way to route e-mail into folders
without having to touch your filter script. I used to edit my filter
script often to add or remove e-mail lists and often would fat
finger something and enter a typo. This would result in all my
e-mail bouncing and all in all would be a real bummer.

I wanted to make it syntax simple so it wouldn't end up looking
like to awful procmail recipe or some cryptic piece of junk.
