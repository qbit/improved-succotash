fts-xapian is a full-text search plugin for Dovecot. It utilises the Xapian
search engine library to index email automatically, and allow rapid body and
header server-side search over IMAP.

The authors intend this plugin to provide the functionality provided by the
now-deprecated fts_squat plugin, and provide a simpler way to configure FTS for
Dovecot without needing heavy external dependencies such as Solr.
