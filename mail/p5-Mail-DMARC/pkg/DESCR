This Perl module is a suite of tools for implementing DMARC. It adheres
very tightly to the 2013 DMARC draft, intending to implement every MUST
and every SHOULD.

This module can be used...

- by MTAs and filtering tools like SpamAssassin to validate that
incoming messages are aligned with the purported sender's policy.

- by email senders, to receive DMARC reports from other mail servers
and display them via CLI and web interfaces.

- by MTA operators to send DMARC reports to DMARC author domains.
