+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPA is now installed, and sample configuration files was created in
${SYMPA_HOME}${SYSCONFDIR}/sympa.conf

Basic configuration
===================

You should first edit them to suit your needs, at least http_host,
domain, listmaster, db_type, db_host, db_user, db_passwd, wwsympa_url
settings in ${SYMPA_HOME}${SYSCONFDIR}/sympa.conf, and then configure the needed
database. For SQLite, you need to manually create the database file and make
sure _sympa user can write to it.

You should also install the corresponding p5-DBD-{mysql,SQLite,Pg} module.
Moreover, p5-ldap package is needed if you plan to use LDAP features
and p5-SOAP-Lite package is needed if you plan to use sympa_soap_server.

WWSympa configuration
=====================

To enable WWSympa within nginx once wwsympa.fcgi has been spawned,
a sample configuration for nginx follows.

----<>----<>----<>----<>----<>----
server {
	server_name sympa.example.com;

	location /static-sympa {
		alias /var/www/sympa/;
	}


	location / {
	fastcgi_pass localhost:1026;
	fastcgi_split_path_info ^(/sympa)(.+)$;
	include fastcgi_params;
	fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
	fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME ${LOCALBASE}/libexec/sympa/wwsympa-wrapper.fcgi;
	}
}
----<>----<>----<>----<>----<>----

With that, WWSympa should be available at http://sympa.example.com/sympa/

Startup/Shutdown configuration
==============================

You can control sympa/wwsympa.fcgi daemons using the rc scripts in
${RCDIR}.

Mail aliases configuration
==========================

Add systemwide robot aliases to your aliases file:

sympa: "| ${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/queue sympa@domain.tld"
listmaster: "| ${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/queue listmaster@domain.tld"
bounce+*: "| ${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/bouncequeue sympa@domain.tld"
abuse-feedback-report: "| ${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/bouncequeue sympa@domain.tld"
sympa-request: postmaster
sympa-owner: postmaster

if you're using sendmail, you should declare ${SYMPA_HOME}/sympa_aliases
as an additional alias file in your sendmail.mc :

define(`ALIAS_FILE', `/etc/mail/aliases,${SYMPA_HOME}/sympa_aliases')dnl

If you're using postfix, edit main.cf and set :

alias_database = hash:/etc/mail/aliases, hash:${SYMPA_HOME}/sympa_aliases
alias_maps = hash:/etc/mail/aliases, hash:${SYMPA_HOME}/sympa_aliases

Security considerations
=======================

Note that the following binaries are installed with particular modes/owner/group :
- the following are 4755 _sympa:_sympa
${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/bouncequeue
${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/familyqueue
${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/queue
- the following are 6755 _sympa:_sympa
${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/sympa_soap_server-wrapper.fcgi
${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/wwsympa-wrapper.fcgi
- the following is 4750 root:_sympa
${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/sympa/sympa_newaliases-wrapper

For the various set-uid sympa wrappers to work fine, you have to make
sure ${SYMPA_HOME} is in a partition mounted without nosuid.

Now refer to http://www.sympa.org/manual/index for more information.
