Pilot is a simple, display-oriented file system browser based on the
Alpine message system composer.  As with Alpine, commands are displayed
at the bottom of the screen, and context-sensitive help is provided.

This package is built using the re-alpine source, the continuation of
the Alpine email client from University of Washington.
