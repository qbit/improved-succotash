Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based mail client for Unix-like
operating systems. Features include support for multiple mailbox formats
(including IMAP, POP3, mbox, MMDF, MH, Maildir), MIME/RFC2047, message
threading, encryption and signing with PGP/GPG and S/MIME, and many
operations can use regular expressions. It's highly customizable with
many options for colours, key bindings, display formats etc.

NeoMutt tracks mainstream Mutt release, but adds extra functionality
previously available through separate patchsets. Bug reports should go
to NeoMutt and not Mutt upstream.

Flavors:
	gpgme      - build with support for GPGME, simplifying use with GnuPG:
                     "set crypt_use_gpgme = yes" in muttrc, and run gpg-agent:
                     "export GPG_TTY=$(tty); eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)".
                     also enables autocrypt (which depends on gpgme).
	notmuch	   - build with notmuch support (fulltext indexing and tagging)
	sasl	   - build with SASL authentication support
