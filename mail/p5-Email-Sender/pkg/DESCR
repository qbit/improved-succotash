Email::Sender replaces the old and sometimes problematic Email::Send
library, which did a decent job at handling very simple email sending
tasks, but was not suitable for serious use, for a variety of
reasons.

Most users will be able to use Email::Sender::Simple to send mail.
Users with more specific needs should look at the available
Email::Sender::Transport classes.
