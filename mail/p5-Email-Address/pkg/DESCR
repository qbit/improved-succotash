DEPRECATED class implementing an RFC 2822 parser that locates email
addresses in strings and returns a list of Email::Address objects found.
Alternately you may construct objects manually.

"This module has a vulnerability (CVE-2015-7686) which allows remote
attackers to cause denial of service. In other words, sometimes it takes
way too long to process certain kinds of input. Maybe someday this will
be fixed. Until then, use Email::Address::XS instead which has backward
compatible API."
