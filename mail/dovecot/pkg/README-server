| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, the _dovecot user, and so the Dovecot processes run in
the login(1) class of "dovecot".

The capability database file is located at /etc/login.conf.d/dovecot

For larger servers these numbers and memory limits (e.g. datasize
and stacksize) may also need to be increased. Please report any
changes and experiences to the package maintainers so that we can
update this file for future versions.
