Rspamd is an advanced spam filtering system that allows evaluation of messages
by a number of rules including regular expressions, statistical analysis and
custom services such as URL black lists. Each message is analysed by rspamd and
given a spam score.

According to this spam score and the user's settings rspamd recommends an action
for the MTA to apply to the message- for example to pass, reject or add a
header. Rspamd is designed to process hundreds of messages per second
simultaneously and has a number of features available.

Some flavours are available, depending on the machine architecture:

	no_luajit	Disable luajit, available on all architectures
	(unflavoured)	Enable luajit, available on amd64/i386
	hyperscan	Use Intel's hyperscan library, available on amd64,
			requires certain CPU features.
