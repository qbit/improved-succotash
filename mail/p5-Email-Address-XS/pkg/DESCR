This module implements RFC 5322 parser and formatter of email addresses
and groups. It parses an input string from email headers which contain a
list of email addresses or a groups of email addresses (like From, To,
Cc, Bcc, Reply-To, Sender, ...). Also it can generate a string value for
those headers from a list of email addresses objects. Module is backward
compatible with RFC 2822 and RFC 822.

Parser and formatter functionality is implemented in XS and uses shared
code from Dovecot IMAP server.

It is a drop-in replacement for the Email::Address module which has
several denial-of-service issues. Most existing applications can
be switched by replacing every "Email::Address" occurrence with
"Email::Address::XS".
