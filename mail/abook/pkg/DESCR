Address book program with mutt mail client support.

abook uses curses libs and is able to import and export from other
address book formats (including ldif, vcard, csv and more).

It is nice for querying from within mutt; to use it as such, add
the following to your muttrc:

  set query_command="${PREFIX}/bin/abook --mutt-query '%s'".
