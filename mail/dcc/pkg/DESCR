The Distributed Checksum Clearinghouses or DCC is an anti-spam content
filter that runs on a variety of operating systems. The counts can be
used by SMTP servers and mail user agents to detect and reject or filter
spam or unsolicited bulk mail. DCC servers exchange or "flood" common
checksums. The checksums include values that are constant across common
variations in bulk messages, including "personalizations."

The DCC software is distributed under a license that is free only to
organizations that participate in the global DCC network. ISPs that use
DCC to filter mail for their own users are intended to be covered by the
license. You can redistribute unchanged copies of the DCC source, but
you may not redistribute modified, "fixed," or "improved" versions of
the source or binaries. You also can't call it your own or blame anyone
for the results of using it.

Organizations selling anti-spam appliances or managed mail services are
not eligible for the free license.

The DCC client programs are configured to use the public DCC servers by
default. You should use these if your mail system handles fewer than
100,000 messages per day. If your system handles more than that, you
should run your own local DCC servers as part of the global network.
