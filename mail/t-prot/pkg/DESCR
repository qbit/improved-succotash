t-prot (TOFU Protection) is a filter which improves the readability of
email messages and Usenet posts by hiding some of their annoying parts.
The annoyances it handles include mailing list footers, signatures,
TOFU, sequences of blank lines, and repeated punctuation. TOFU is an
acronym that stands for "Text oben, Fullquote unten", a German reference
to the practice of adding just a few lines of original text and quoting
a complete message below them.
