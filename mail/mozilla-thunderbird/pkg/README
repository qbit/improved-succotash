If you encounter strange problems or Thunderbird doesn't start at
all, try the -safe-mode switch.

Links
=====
To make Thunderbird open links using Firefox, shut down Thunderbird
and add these lines to ~/.thunderbird/<something>.default/prefs.js:

user_pref("network.protocol-handler.app.http", "${LOCALBASE}/bin/firefox");
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.app.https", "${LOCALBASE}/bin/firefox");

Chat with OTR
=============

If you plan to use OTR within the chat feature of thunderbird, make sure libotr
package is installed.
# pkg_add libotr

Send/receive encrypted/signed mail
==================================

Thunderbird 78 provides OpenPGP email encryption via RNP, which was previously
optionally available via the Enigmail extension and GnuPG. All basic OpenPGP
features (encrypt/decrypt/sign) are available out of the box. Support for
smartcards is incomplete, only decryption works at this time, signing is not
yet implemented. To use the experimental smartcard support, which is
implemented as a fallback to GnuPG for secret key operations, install the gpgme
package.

https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/openpgp-thunderbird-howto-and-faq is the
reference documentation for this feature.

Debugging
=========
If you encounter crashes, you might want to install the debug part of
this package, and run thunderbird inside gdb, so that you can gather
debugging logs and traces for all threads.
Bug reports without that information will be ignored.
