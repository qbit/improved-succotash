To use filter-spamassassin, you must declare it in smtpd.

Edit the /etc/mail/smtpd.conf file to declare the filter:

  filter "spamassassin" proc-exec "filter-spamassassin"

Then add the filter to each listener that should be filtered:

  listen on socket filter "spamassassin"
  listen on all filter "spamassassin"

The filter itself does have some additional configurations, you can look at them
in filter-spamassassin(1) man page.
