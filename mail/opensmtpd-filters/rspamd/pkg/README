To use filter-rspamd, you must declare it in smtpd.

Edit the /etc/mail/smtpd.conf file to declare the filter:

  filter "rspamd" proc-exec "filter-rspamd"

Then add the filter to each listener that should be filtered:

  listen on socket filter "rspamd"
  listen on all filter "rspamd"

The filter itself doesn't have configuration and is controlled by
the Rspamd configuration itself.
