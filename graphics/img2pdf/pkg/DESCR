The program will take image filenames from commandline arguments and output
a PDF file with them embedded into it. If the input image is a JPEG or
JPEG2000 file, it will be included as-is without any processing. If it is
in any other format, the image will be included as zip-encoded RGB.
As a result, this tool will be able to lossless wrap any image into a
PDF container while performing better (in terms of quality/filesize ratio)
than existing tools in case the input image is a JPEG or JPEG2000 file.
