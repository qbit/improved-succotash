Leptonica is a pedagogically-oriented open source site containing
software that is broadly useful for image processing and image analysis
applications.

Featured operations are
    * Rasterop (a.k.a. bitblt)
    * Affine transformations (scaling, translation, rotation, shear) on
      images of arbitrary pixel depth
    * Binary and grayscale morphology, rank order, and convolution
    * Seedfill and connected components
    * Image transformations combining changes in scale and pixel depth
    * Pixelwise masking, blending, enhancement, arithmetic ops, etc.

Ancillary operations include
    * I/O for standard image formats
    * Utilities to handle arrays of image-related data types
    * Utilities for generic stacks, queues, heaps and lists; and for
      byte queues and arrays of numbers and strings
