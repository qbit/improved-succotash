pngquant is a PNG compressor that significantly reduces file
sizes by converting images to a more efficient 8-bit PNG format
with alpha channel (often 60-80% smaller than 24/32-bit PNG
files). Compressed images are fully standards-compliant and
are supported by all web browsers and operating systems.
