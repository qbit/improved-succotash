ImageMagick is a software suite (library and primarily command-line
tools) to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. It can read
and write images in a variety of formats including PNG, JPEG, JPEG-2000,
GIF, TIFF, DPX, EXR, WebP, Postscript, PDF, and SVG. Use ImageMagick
to resize, flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and transform images,
adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines,
polygons, ellipses and Bezier curves.
