HP scanners need the hplip and hpaio packages installed.

USB
===
Since USB scanning will be handled by libusb, you need to allow
the user access to the corresponding USB endpoint. To do so, find
where your scanner is attached to using:
    $ usbdevs -v
then change the ownerships accordingly.

e.g.                                                                            
Controller /dev/usb0:                                                           
<...>

         driver: ugen1                                                          
                                                                                
# chown <username> /dev/ugen1.* /dev/usb0

To preserve your changes after a system update, use rc.local(8).
Alternatively, hotplugd(8) attach/detach scripts can automate this.

You can grant multiple users direct access to the scanner by adding them to the
_saned group and allowing access to its ugen(4) device.
e.g. chgrp _saned /dev/ugen1.* && chmod 660 /dev/ugen1.*

SCSI
====
SANE only supports the generic SCSI uk(4) devices.
Make sure your user account has access to the scanner device node or you
will not be able to scan.

LOCKING
=======
Some backends (like sane-plustek(5)) use a lockfile for allowing
multiple access to one scanner. If using such a backend, you must
add yourself to the _saned group or you will not be able to scan.

NETWORK
=======
By default, the saned(8) daemon runs as _saned, so you need to allow the
_saned user access to the scanner device node.
