QR (Quick Response) codes are 2D pictographic codes that can encode many types
of data. They can be quickly machine-read and are quite robust.

This package provides qrcode, a pure Python module to generate QR codes, with
direct output as SVG, or in other image formats via modules such as Pillow and
pymaging.

It also provides qr(1), a script using the above module, which can take data
from standard input or the command line and format as a QR code. By default,
ASCII art will be used if output is directed to the terminal, otherwise an
image file will be output.
