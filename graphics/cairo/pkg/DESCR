Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices.
Currently supported output targets include the X Window System (via both
Xlib and XCB), quartz, win32, and image buffers, as well as PDF,
PostScript, and SVG file output. Experimental backends include OpenGL,
BeOS, OS/2, and DirectFB.

Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media while
taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available (for
example, through the X Render Extension).

The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of
PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo include stroking and filling
cubic Bezier splines, transforming and compositing translucent
images, and antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be
transformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.).
