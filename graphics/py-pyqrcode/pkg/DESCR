The pyqrcode module is a QR code generator that is simple to use and written in
pure python. The module can automate most of the building process for creating
QR codes. Most codes can be created using only two lines of code!

Unlike other generators, all of the helpers can be controlled manually. You are
free to set any or all of the properties of your QR code.

QR codes can be saved in several formats. They can also be displayed directly in
most terminal emulators.
