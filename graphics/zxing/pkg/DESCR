ZXing (pronounced "zebra crossing") is an open-source, multi-format 1D/2D
barcode image processing library and command-line tool. It supports:

	Aztec			EAN-8 and EAN-13
	Codabar			ITF
	Code 128		PDF 417
	Code 39			QR Code
	Code 93			RSS-14 (all variants)
	Data Matrix		UPC-A and UPC-E

The original ZXing project no longer provides the C++ code; this package
is built from Glass Echidna's fork.
