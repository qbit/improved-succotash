Clutter is an open source software library for creating fast,
compelling, portable, and dynamic graphical user interfaces.

Clutter uses OpenGL for rendering, but wraps an easy to use, efficient,
flexible API around GL's complexity.
Clutter enforces no particular user interface style, but provides a
rich, generic foundation for higher-level toolkits tailored to
specific needs.
