This is a Python script to convert the output from many profilers into a dot
graph.

It has the following features:

- reads output from:
- Linux perf
- Valgrind's callgrind tool
- oprofile
- sysprof
- xperf
- VTune Amplifier XE
- Very Sleepy
- python profilers
- Java's HPROF
- prof, gprof
- prunes nodes and edges below a certain threshold;
- uses an heuristic to propagate time inside mutually recursive functions;
- uses color efficiently to draw attention to hot-spots;
- works on any platform where Python and graphviz is available, i.e, virtually anywhere.
