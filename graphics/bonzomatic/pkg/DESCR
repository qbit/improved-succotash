Bonzomatic is a live-coding tool, where you can write a 2D fragment/pixel shader
while it is running in the background.

The tool was originally conceived and implemented after the Revision 2014
demoscene party's live coding competition where two contestants improv-code an
effect in 25 minutes head-to-head.

At least OpenGL 4.1 is required, which is supported by
3rd generation Intel Core i3/i5/i7 "Ivy Bridge" processors and
ATI/AMD TeraScale 2 "Evergreen" chipsets or later.
