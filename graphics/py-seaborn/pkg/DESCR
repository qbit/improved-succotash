Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It is
built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data
structures. Seaborn aims to make visualization a central part of
exploring and understanding data. Its dataset-oriented plotting
functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and
internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical
aggregation to produce informative plots.
