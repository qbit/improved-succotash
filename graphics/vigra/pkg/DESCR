VIGRA stands for "Vision with Generic Algorithms". It's an image
processing and analysis library that puts its main emphasis on
customizable algorithms and data structures. VIGRA is especially strong
for multi-dimensional images, because many algorithms (e.g. filters,
feature computation, superpixels) are implemented for arbitrary high
dimensions.
