The OpenJPEG library is an open-source JPEG 2000 codec written in the C
language. It has been developed in order to promote the use of the JPEG 2000
still-image compression standard from the Joint Photographic Experts Group
(JPEG).

This package provides the 2.x library, it is separate from the 1.5 library
due to major API differences.
