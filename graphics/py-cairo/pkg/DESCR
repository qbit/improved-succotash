Pycairo is a Python module providing bindings for the cairo graphics library.

The Pycairo bindings are designed to match the cairo C API as closely as
possible, and to deviate only in cases which are clearly better implemented in a
more 'Pythonic' way.

Features of the Pycairo bindings:

* Provides an object oriented interface to cairo.
* Queries the error status of objects and translates them to exceptions.
* Provides a C API that can be used by other Python extensions.
