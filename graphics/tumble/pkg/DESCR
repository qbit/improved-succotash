Tumble is a utility to construct PDF files from one or more image
files.  Supported input image file formats are JPEG, and black and
white 1-bit TIFF (single- or multi-page).

Black and white images will be encoded in the PDF output using
lossless Group 4 fax compression (ITU-T recommendation T.6).  This
provides a very good compression ratio for text and line art.  JPEG
images will be preserved with the original coding.

The general command line syntax is:

tumble [options] <input>... -o <output.pdf>

The options in this mode are:

    -v        verbose
    -b <fmt>  create bookmarks

If the "-b" option is given, bookmarks will be created using the
format string, which may contain arbitrary text and/or the following
format specifiers:

    %F  file name, sans suffix  e.g., "foo.tif" will just appear as "foo"
    %p  page number of input file, useful for multipage TIFF files
