Blurhash is an algorithm that lets you transform image data into a small
text representation of a blurred version of the image. This is useful
since this small textual representation can be included when sending
objects that may have images attached around, which then can be used to
quickly create a placeholder for images that are still loading or that
should be hidden behind a content warning.
