fio is a IO benchmarking tool that can simulate various user defined
workloads. fio will spawn a number of threads or processes doing a
particular type of IO action as specified by the user.  It takes a
number of global parameters, each inherited by the thread unless other
parameters given to them overriding that setting.  The typical use of
fio is to write a job file matching the IO load one wants to simulate.
