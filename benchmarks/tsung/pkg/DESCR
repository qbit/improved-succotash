Tsung is an open-source multi-protocol distributed load testing tool.
It can be used to stress HTTP, WebDAV, SOAP, PostgreSQL, MySQL, LDAP,
MQTT and Jabber/XMPP servers.  The purpose of Tsung is to simulate users
in order to test the scalability and performance of IP based
client/server applications. You can use it to do load and stress testing
of your servers. Many protocols have been implemented and tested, and it
can be easily extended.
