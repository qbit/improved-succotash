Gaps configuration
==================
Gaps will only work correctly if you disable window titlebars entirely.
Unfortunately this is necessary due to the way i3 creates such bars on
windows.

You can disable them via:

for_window [class="^.*"] border pixel 0

in your config. You can also use any non-zero value as long as you only
use pixel-style borders.
