Konqueror is KDE's Webbrowser and swiss-army-knife for any kind of
file-management and file previewing.

Features:

-  Webbrowsing using Qt WebEngine as rendering engines
-  File management using most of Dolphin's features (including version-control,
   service menus and the basic UI)
-  File management on ftp and sftp servers
-  Full featured FTP-client (you can split views to display local and remote
   folders and previews in the same window)
-  Embedded applications to preview files (e.g. Okular and Calligra for
   documents, Gwenview for pictures, KTextEditor for text-files)
-  Different kinds of plugins: Service-menus, KParts (embedded applications),
   KIO (accessing files using special protocols like http or ftp) and
   KPart-plugins (like AdBlocker...)
