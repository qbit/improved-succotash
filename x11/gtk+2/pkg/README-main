Themes
======

Default
-------
The default GTK+ theme engine can be modified by editing:
    ~/.gtkrc-2.0
and appending a line similar to:
include "${LOCALBASE}/share/themes/oxygen-gtk/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"

Extras
------
Some themes are available as packages ("gtk2-*-engine").

You may want to install the "gnome-themes-extra" package if you need:
- The GTK+ 2 version of Adwaita
- Adwaita-dark as a separate theme, along with its GTK+ 2 equivalent
- GTK+ 2 versions of the HighContrast themes
- The legacy HighContrast icon theme
- Index files needed for Adwaita to be used outside of GNOME

Sound
-----
GTK+ itself does not support event sounds, you have to use a loadable module
like the one that comes with libcanberra which is loaded automatically when a
GTK+ application is launched.
You may want to install the "libcanberra-gtk" package if you require these.

Printing
========

Preview
-------
By default, GTK+ uses the "evince" command from the evince package to
display a "Print Preview". This can be modified by editing:
    ~/.gtkrc-2.0
and appending the following line:
gtk-print-preview-command = "epdfview %f"

(epdfview can be replaced by any other PDF viewer command like xpdf...)

Note that by default, "evince" will remove the temporary PDF preview
file (/tmp/previewXXXXX.pdf) when done, that might not be the case with
other PDF viewers.

CUPS
----
Printing to CUPS requires installing the gtk+2-cups package.
