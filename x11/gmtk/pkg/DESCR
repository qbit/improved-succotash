gmtk is a toolkit library used by gnome-mplayer and gecko-mediaplayer:
several common functions and routines formerly in gnome-mplayer and
gecko-mediaplayer have been moved to this library.
Since gmtk provides a complete set of widgets to control mplayer,
it can also be used to quickly develop new GTK based media players.
