Oxygen-Gtk is a port of the default KDE widget theme (Oxygen) to GTK+3.

Its primary goal is to ensure visual consistency between GTK+3 and
QT-based applications running under KDE. A secondary objective is to
also have a stand-alone nice looking GTK theme that behaves well in
other desktop environments.
