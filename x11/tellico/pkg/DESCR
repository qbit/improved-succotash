Tellico is a KDE application for organizing your collections. It
provides default templates for books, bibliographies, videos, music,
video games, coins, stamps, trading cards, comic books, and wines.

Tellico allows you to enter your collection in a catalogue database,
saving many different properties like title, author, etc. Two
different views of your collection are shown.
