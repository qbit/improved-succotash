| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

System tray icon
================

The OpenBSD package of ${PKGSTEM} currently does not include support for the
system tray icon. However, it can be controlled entirely through the command
line.

For example, `gromit-mpx -t` toggles gromit-mpx on/off and `gromit-mpx -c`
clears previous scribbles. See the gromit-mpx(1) manual for further options.

Interference with desktop environments
======================================

Some desktop environments (e.g. XFCE) will interfere with ${PKGSTEM}'s ability
to grab its hot keys (F8 and F9 by default). In these cases it may be easiest
to set the hotkeys to an obscure key (e.g. "Pause") and configure keyboard
shortcuts for the desktop environment that invoke gromit-mpx.

In your gromit-mpx.cfg:

```
HOTKEY = "Pause";
UNDOKEY = "Pause";
```

Then configure key bindings that call `gromit-mpx(1)` in your desktop
environment.

Using a compositor
==================

You should probably use a compositor with ${PKGSTEM}.

"When there is no compositing manager such as Compiz or xcompmgr running,
Gromit-MPX falls back to a legacy drawing mode. This may drastically slow down
your X-Server, especially when you draw very thin lines. It makes heavy use of
the shape extension, which is quite expensive if you paint a complex pattern on
screen. Especially terminal-programs tend to scroll incredibly slow if
something is painted over their window."
