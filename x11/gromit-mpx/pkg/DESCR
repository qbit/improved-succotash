Gromit-MPX (GRaphics Over MIscellaneous Things) is a small tool to make
annotations on the screen. Its main use is for making presentations of some
application. Normally, you would have to move the mouse pointer around the
point of interest until hopefully everybody noticed it. With Gromit-MPX, you
can draw everywhere onto the screen, highlighting some button or area.
