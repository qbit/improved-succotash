xli is an image display program for X. It is a fork of xloadimage.

A variety of options are available to modify images prior to viewing.
These options include clipping, dithering, depth reduction, zoom (either
X or Y axis independently or both at once), brightening or darkening,
input gamma correction, and image merging. When applicable, these
options are done automatically (eg. a color image to be displayed on a
monochrome screen will be dithered automatically). A utility (xlito) is
provided that allows these viewing options to be appended to the image
files.

xli can also be used to set the X background image if called as xsetbg.
