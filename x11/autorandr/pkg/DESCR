autorandr allows for automatic xrandr configuration based on the current
hardware configuration. Users are able to define different hardware profiles,
which autorandr will manage. Calling autorandr will then configure xrandr
automatically.

This is especially handy for laptop users who dock/undock their laptop
to external displays.
