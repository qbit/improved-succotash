Clipboard allows access to the x11 clipboard from Perl via the
"Clipboard->copy('string');" and "print Clipboard->paste();" subs

Clipboard also adds a few CLI utilities: 
clipaccumulate: combine many copies into one big paste.
clipbrowse: loads a url from the clipboard into a browser.
clipedit: edits current clipboard
clipfilter: allows for arbitrary filtering of clipboard.
clipjoin: removes extra whitespaces from clipboard.
