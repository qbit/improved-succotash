QtWayland is a Qt 5 module that wraps the functionality of Wayland. QtWayland
is separated into a client and server side. The client side is the wayland
platform plugin, and provides a way to run Qt applications as Wayland clients.
The server side is the Qt Wayland Compositor API, and allows users to write
their own Wayland compositors.
