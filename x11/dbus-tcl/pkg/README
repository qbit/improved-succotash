As of version 2.0:
The 'dbus-tcl' Tcl package is now called 'dbus'.

Man and doc files dbus-tcl.n and dbus-tcl.html are
now dbus.n and dbus.html, respectively.
All other port files and directories remain 'dbus-tcl'.

Occurrences of [package require dbus-tcl]
should be changed to [package require dbus].
