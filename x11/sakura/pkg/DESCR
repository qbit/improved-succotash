Sakura is a simple but powerful libvte based terminal emulator,
supporting UTF-8 and input methods as provided by GTK+ and Pango
libraries.

Sakura is a terminal emulator based on just GTK and VTE. It's a terminal
emulator with few dependencies, so you don't need a full GNOME desktop
installed to have a decent terminal emulator. Some of the terminal
emulators based on VTE are gnome-terminal, XFCE Terminal, Termit, etc.
Sakura just uses a notebook to provide several terminals in one window
and adds a contextual menu with some basic options. No more no less.
