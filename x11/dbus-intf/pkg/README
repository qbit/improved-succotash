| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As of version 1.0:
The 'dbus-intf' Tcl package is now called 'dbif'.

Man and doc files dbus-intf.n and dbus-intf.html are
now dbif.n and dbif.html, respectively.
All other port files and directories remain 'dbus-intf'.

Occurrences of [package require dbus-intf]
should be changed to [package require dbif].
