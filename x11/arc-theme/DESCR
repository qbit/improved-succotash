Arc is a flat theme with ${ARC_TYPE} elements for GTK and various desktop
shells, window managers and applications. It's well suited for GTK based desktop
environments such as GNOME, Cinnamon, Xfce, Unity, MATE, Budgie etc.

Note that the gtk+2 theme requires needs the "gtk2-murrine-engine" package.
The dependency is not enforced by default because gtk+2 is phasing out.
Similarly, the "arc-icon-theme" package matches this theme for icons but is not
enforced either.
