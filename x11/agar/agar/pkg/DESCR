Agar is a cross-platform GUI toolkit. Agar provides a base framework and a
collection of GUI widgets from which GUI applications can be built. Agar can
be styled and themed using a CSS-style engine.

Agar applications work seamlessly under X11 (with OpenGL), Windows, MacOS X
and SDL 1.2. Agar can also attach to an OpenGL or SDL context and operate as
window manager for the application. Agar is compact, efficient, and fully
thread-safe. Its functionality can be extended using simple C/C++ class
registration interfaces.
