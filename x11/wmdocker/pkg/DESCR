Docker is a docking application (WindowMaker dock app) which acts as a
system tray for KDE and GNOME2. It can be used to replace the panel in
either environment, allowing you to have a system tray without running
the KDE/GNOME panel or environment.

To avoid conflicting with sysutils/docker-cli, the name of package and
binary is changed to "wmdocker".
