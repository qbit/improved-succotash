Migrating to 0.9.3
==================

The command cycle_value now expects an attribute path instead of a settings
name. For compatibility reasons, passing settings name directly (without the
prefix settings.) is still supported.

In ipc commands, herbstclient prints error messages always on stderr and normal
output always on stdout. Before, both were printed to the same channel, either
to stdout or stderr depending on the commandâ€™s exit status. This mainly
affects combined commands.

In the rules, toggle can not be used anymore in rule consequences. Moreover,
invalid arguments to rule consequences now will be reported during rule
creation, already.

Migrating to 0.9.0
==================

The tag_renamed hook has changed. The hook now emits two parameters. The first
parameter contains the old name of the tag and the second parameter is the new
name of the tag.
