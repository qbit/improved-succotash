The Yaru Ubuntu GNOME theme contains:

- a GNOME Shell theme
- a GTK2 and GTK3 theme
- an icon & cursor theme, derived from the Suru icon theme
- a sound theme, combining sounds from the WoodenBeaver and Touch-Remix sound
  themes with an emphasis on making sound a usability feature instead of an
  annoyance
