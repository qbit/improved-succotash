Default Keybindings
===================

The notion default keybindings assume a standard US keyboard layout. In
some situations, default keys cannot be mapped because they are either
not available (for example grave key on a Germany layout) or Caps_Lock
(when you mapped Ctrl or Esc to it).

When starting notion, a popup will show you which key bindings it was
not able to map.

You can adjust bindings system wide by editing
${SYSCONFDIR}/notion/cfg_bindings.lua or only for your user by copying
${LOCALBASE}/share/examples/notion/cfg_bindings.lua to ~/.notion.

$ mkdir ~/.notion/
$ cp ${LOCALBASE}/share/examples/notion/cfg_bindings.lua ~/.notion/

Then adjust the binding that causes trouble. For example by searching
for "grave" or "Caps_Lock" and assigning another key.

Extensive documentation on keybindings and general notion configuration
can be found in the "Documentation" section on the notion website:
