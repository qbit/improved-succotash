Notion is a static tiling, tabbed window manager for the X window system.

Notion simply divides the screen into frames that take the whole screen.
Big displays have so much space that this is convenient and smaller
displays couldn't show more than one window at a time anyway. The frames
can be split and growing the size of one will shrink others.

Notion is the successor of Ion3, which has been discontinued in 2009.
