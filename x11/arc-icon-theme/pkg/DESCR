The Arc Icon Theme is still unfinished: it mainly includes icons for folders and
mimetypes for the Arc GTK theme.

This theme doesn't provide application icons, it needs another icon theme to
inherit them. By default this theme will look for the Moka icon theme to get the
missing icons.
To change the application icons, edit `Arc/index.theme` and replace `Moka` with
the name of your preferred icon theme.
