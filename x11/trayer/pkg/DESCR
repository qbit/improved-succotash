trayer-srg was forked from trayer in january 2010 to add some fancy features and
clean up code.
 
Trayer is small program designed to provide systray functionality present in
GNOME/KDE desktop enviroments for window managers which don't support that
function. It's similar to other applications such as 'peksystray' and 'docker'.
