ARandR is designed to provide a simple visual front end for XRandR.
Relative monitor positions are shown graphically and can be changed in a
drag-and-drop way.

Features
--------

* Full control over output positioning
  (instead of plain "left of") with edge snapping
* Saving configurations as executable shell scripts
  (configurations can be loaded without using this program)
* Configuration files can be edited to include additional payload
  (like xsetwacom_ commands tablet PC users need when rotating),
  which is preserved when editing
* Main widget separated from packaged application
  (to facilitate integration with existing solutions)
