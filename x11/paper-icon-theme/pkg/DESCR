Paper is a modern freedesktop icon theme whose design is based around the use
of bold colours and simple geometric shapes to compose icons. Each icon has
been meticulously designed for pixel-perfect viewing.

The Paper cursor theme is a component of the icon set and has a geometrically
simple style designed to compliment the Paper icons.

Paper Icon Theme is designed, developed and maintained by Sam Hewitt under the
