The GNOME Display Manager is a system service that is responsible for
providing graphical log-ins and managing local and remote displays.

Note that GDM runs a full gnome-session when starting, but dependency on
the gnome-session package is not enforced in this package to prevent a
dependency loop:
    gdm -> gnome-session -> gnome-shell -> gdm
