Yelp is the default help browser for the GNOME desktop.  Yelp provides a simple
graphical interface for viewing DocBook, HTML, man, and info formatted
documentation.

Displaying manual pages requires GNU groff(1) from the textproc/groff port which
dependency is not enforced. It can be installed using `doas pkg_add groff'.
