This module houses themes and theme-y tidbits that don't really fit in anywhere
else, or deserve their own module. At the moment this consists of:

* The GTK+ 2 version of Adwaita
* Adwaita-dark as a separate theme, along with its GTK+ 2 equivalent
* GTK+ 2 versions of the HighContrast themes
* The legacy HighContrast icon theme
* Index files needed for Adwaita to be used outside of GNOME
