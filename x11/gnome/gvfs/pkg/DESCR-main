gvfs is a userspace virtual filesystem designed to work with the i/o
abstractions of gio. It installs several modules that are automatically
used by applications using the APIs of libgio.

gvfs comes with a set of backends, including trash support, sftp, smb,
http, dav and others.

There is a set of command line programs starting with "gvfs-" that
lets you run commands (like cat, ls, stat, etc) on files in the gvfs
mounts.
