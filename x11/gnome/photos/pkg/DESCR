Photos is an application to access, organize and share your photos with
GNOME.

Photos, like Documents, Music and Videos, is one of the core GNOME
applications meant for find and reminding the user about her content.
The internal architecture Photos is based on Documents -- the document
manager application for GNOME, because they share similar UI/UX
patterns and objectives.
