i3 is an improved dynamic, tiling window manager originally inspired
by wmii.

This fork adds support for dragging tiled windows using the mouse.
Hopefully it will be merged to the main branch at some point (see
https://github.com/i3/i3/pull/3085) and this separate package will
no longer be necessary.
