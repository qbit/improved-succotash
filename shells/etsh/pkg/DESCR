The Etsh Project provides two ports of the original /bin/sh from Sixth
Edition (V6) UNIX (circa 1975).

Etsh(1) is an enhanced, backward-compatible port of the Sixth Edition
Thompson shell. Tsh(1) is an unenhanced port of the shell, and glob(1)
is a port of its global command. Together, tsh and glob provide a user
interface which is backward compatible with that provided by the Sixth
Edition Thompson shell and global command, but without the obvious
enhancements found in etsh.

The original Thompson shell was principally written by Ken Thompson of
Bell Labs.

Additionally, this project includes the following shell utilities:
* if(1) - conditional command (ported from Sixth Edition UNIX)
* goto(1) - transfer command (ported from Sixth Edition UNIX)
* fd2(1) - redirect from/to file descriptor 2
