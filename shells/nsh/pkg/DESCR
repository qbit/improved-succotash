NSH is a CLI intended for OpenBSD-based network appliances. It replaces
ifconfig, sysctl and route with its own simple command language, and
consolidates configuration and control of other daemons into one place,
presenting the user with a vaguely cisco-like interface.

Flavour: static - link statically.
