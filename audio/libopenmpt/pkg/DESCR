libopenmpt is a cross-platform C++ and C library to decode tracked music
files (modules) into a raw PCM audio stream.

openmpt123 is a cross-platform command-line or terminal based module file
player.

libopenmpt is based on the player code of the OpenMPT project (Open ModPlug
Tracker). In order to avoid code base fragmentation, libopenmpt is developed
in the same source code repository as OpenMPT.
