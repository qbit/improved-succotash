RNNoise is a noise suppression library based on a recurrent neural network.
A description of the algorithm is provided in the following paper:

While it is meant to be used as a library, the code for a simple command-line
tool is provided as an example. It operates on RAW 16-bit (machine endian) mono
PCM files sampled at 48 kHz.
