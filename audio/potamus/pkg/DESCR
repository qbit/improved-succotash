Potamus is a lightweight GTK-based audio player with a simple interface
and an emphasis on high audio quality.

It was written to make use of the filesystem for sorting music, unlike
larger audio players that use a complex database.

Files can be added to the database in one of two ways: either by drag
and drop into the playlist or by passing files or directories on the
command line.
