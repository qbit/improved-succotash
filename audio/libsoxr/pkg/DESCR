The SoX Resampler library `libsoxr' performs one-dimensional sample-rate
conversion -- it may be used, for example, to resample PCM-encoded audio.
For higher-dimensional resampling, such as for visual-image processing, you
should look elsewhere.

It aims to give fast and very high quality results for any constant
(rational or irrational) resampling ratio.  Phase-response, preserved
bandwidth, aliasing, and rejection level parameters are all configurable;
alternatively, simple `preset' configurations may be selected.  An
experimental, variable-rate resampling mode of operation is also included.
