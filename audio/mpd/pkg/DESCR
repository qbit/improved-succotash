Music Player Daemon allows remote access for playing music (MP3,
Ogg, FLAC, AAC, Mod and WAV files) and managing playlists. MPD is
designed for integrating a computer into a stereo system that
provides control for music playback over a local network.  It also
makes a great desktop music player and has several frontend options.
