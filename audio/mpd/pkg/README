sndiod(8) concurrent access by mpd(1) and other users
=====================================================

sndiod(8) normally only allows access to audio by a single system user
at a time. This is done by generating a random authentication token and
storing it in $HOME/.sndio/cookie when a user first accesses audio,
providing a limited capability to share with other users by copying
the token to their home directory.  See AUTHENTICATION in sndio(7) for
more details.

If you want to share sndiod(8) access with mpd(1) running as the
default _mpd user, you may copy .sndio/cookie from your user's home
directory to /var/spool/mpd/.sndio/cookie.

If you previously had mpd installed on your system, make sure the home
directory of the _mpd user is actually /var/spool/mpd, or reset it
with:

# usermod -d /var/spool/mpd _mpd
