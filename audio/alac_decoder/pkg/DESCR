alac_decoder is a basic decoder for Apple Lossless Audio Codec files
(ALAC). It is a C implementation of a decoder, written from reverse
engineering the file format. ALAC uses an adaptive FIR prediction
algorithm and stores the error values using a modified rice or golumb
algorithm.

The program located here will not be able to handle all ALAC files, it
can only handle mono or stereo files. ALAC allows up to 8 channels. The
ALAC decoder supports both 16 and 24 bit sample sizes.

The decoder can read an ALAC stream from either a file or from stdin,
and write it as raw PCM data or as a WAV file to either stdout or a
file.

An encoder is not provided.
