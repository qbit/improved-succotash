A typical stereo recording is made for reproduction on loudspeakers. That is,
the stereo mix is often made with the assumption that sound from one channel
will be heard in both ears. This is not usually the case with headphone
reproduction. The Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP (bs2b) is designed to
improve headphone listening of stereo audio recordings by reproducing this
effect: some of the sound from each channel also goes to the opposite ear,
arriving a short time later (as extra distance is travelled), with a bit of
high frequency roll-off for the shadowing effect of the head, and additional
time delay for low frequencies than high frequencies.
