puddletag is an audio tag editor similar to the Windows program, Mp3tag.
It uses a spreadsheet-like layout so that all the tags you want to edit
by hand are visible and easily editable.

The usual tag editor features are supported like extracting tag information
from filenames, renaming files based on their tags by using patterns and basic
tag editing.

There are also Functions, which can do things like replace text, trim it, do
case conversions, etc. Actions can automate repetitive tasks.

Supported formats: ID3v1, ID3v2 (mp3), MP4 (mp4, m4a, etc.), VorbisComments
(ogg, flac), Musepack (mpc), Monkeys Audio (.ape) and WavPack (wv).
