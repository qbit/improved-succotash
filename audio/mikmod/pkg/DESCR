Mikmod is a module player and library supporting many formats, including
mod, s3m, it, and xm, collectively known as MOD files.

MOD is a family of music file formats dating back to the Amiga in the
1980s, which allowed for music composition using a computer and sampled
sounds. The format is popular in the demoscene and was used in games
from the 1990s, such as Unreal.
