FluidSynth is a cross-platform real-time software synthesizer based on the
SoundFont 2 specifications including realtime effect modulation. It provides
a library and command-line shell, and can be used to play MIDI files, as
well as acting as a MIDI device via the sndio(7) interface.

To use FluidSynth, you will need to provide a SoundFont 2 file; a general-
purpose file is available in the generaluser-gs-soundfont package.
