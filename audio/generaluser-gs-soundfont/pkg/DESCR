GeneralUser GS is a GM and GS compatible SoundFont bank for composing
or playing MIDI files. This version is for use with FluidSynth (or
Qsynth) (other versions are available for MuseScore, Sound Blaster
Live!/Audigy/X-fi sound cards, and other SoundFont-compatible hardware
and software synthesizers).

The name "GeneralUser" was chosen because the bank was designed to sound
well with all kinds of music rather than specializing in only a few
styles, thereby benefiting the general user.
