abcde is a front end command-line utility that grabs tracks off a CD, encodes
them to OGG or many other formats, and tags and names them with data from
MusicBrainz.org or a CDDB server, all in one go.

That package comes with the default OGG Vorbis support only. For example, to
use the MP3 format, install the lame and eyeD3 packages, and set
OUTPUTTYPE=mp3 in ${SYSCONFDIR}/abcde.conf (copy this to ~/.abcde.conf for
per-user configuration).
