As required by item 3 of the PSF license, here is a brief summary
of changes made to this version of Python for the OpenBSD package.

1.  Regression tests have been taught about OpenBSD.

2.  INSTSONAME could be incorrect, configure.ac was patched to fix it.

3.  RAND_egd support has been disabled, as it is not available in LibreSSL.

These changes are available in the OpenBSD CVS repository
<http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html> in ports/lang/python/2.7.
