M or MUMPS is a a high performance transaction processing key-value database
with integrated programming language. It was originally developed at
Massachusetts General Hospital for managing hospital laboratory information
systems. It is widely used in the healthcare and banking sectors.

Reference Standard M (RSM) is an implementation of the M programming language
and database, which was originally created by Ray Douglas Newman as MUMPS V1
(MV1). The name change to Reference Standard M reflects its role as a reference
implementation for the M Development Committee (MDC). RSM attempts to track and
implement the latest M standard that is released by the MDC, currently ANSI
X11.1-1995.

RSM is developed and maintained by David Wicksell.
