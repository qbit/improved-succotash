TCC (Tiny C Compiler) is a small and fast ANSI C compiler.
It generates optimized code, and can compile, assemble, and link several
times faster than 'gcc -O0'. Any C dynamic library can be used directly.
It includes an optional memory and bounds checker, and bounds-checked
code can be mixed freely with standard code. C scripting is also
supported via the usual hash-bang mechanism.

Backends exist for amd64, i386, arm, and arm64.
