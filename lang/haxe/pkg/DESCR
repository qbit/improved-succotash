Haxe consists of a high-level, open source programming language and a compiler.
It allows compilation of programs, written using an ECMAScript-oriented syntax,
to multiple target languages. Employing proper abstraction, it is possible to
maintain a single code-base which compiles to multiple targets.

Haxe is strongly typed but the typing system can be subverted where required.
Utilizing type information, the Haxe type system can detect errors at
compile-time which would only be noticeable at run-time in the target language.
Furthermore, type information can be used by the compiler to generate optimized
and robust code.
