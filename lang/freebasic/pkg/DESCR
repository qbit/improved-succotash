The FreeBASIC project is a set of cross-platform development tools
consisting of a compiler, GNU-based assembler, linker and archiver, and
supporting runtime libraries, including a software-based graphics
library. The project also contains thin bindings (header files) to some
popular 3rd party libraries such as the C runtime library, Allegro, SDL,
OpenGL, GTK+, the Windows API, and many others.

When used in its "QB" language mode, FreeBASIC provides a high level of
support for programs written in Microsoft QuickBASIC.
