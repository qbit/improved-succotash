Spin is a software verification tool for analyzing the consistency of
asynchronous systems. Examples of asynchronous systems include multi-threaded
programs, distributed systems, and communications protocols. Spin takes a
system model specified in Promela (the PROcess MEta LAnguage). It also takes
a specifciation of the requirements for logical correctness, and allows both
interactive and exhaustive simulations of the system for verifying these
properties.
