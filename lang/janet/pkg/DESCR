Janet is a functional and imperative programming language. The entire
language (core library, interpreter, compiler, assembler) is about
200-300 kB and should run on many constrained systems.

Janet makes a good system scripting language or a language to embed in
other programs, similar Lua or Guile. Janet also can be used for rapid
prototying, dynamic systems, and other domains where lisp shines.

Features include first class closures, garbage collection, lisp macros,
a REPL, the ability to directly interoperate with C including
dynamically loading C libraries, and an extensive core library.
