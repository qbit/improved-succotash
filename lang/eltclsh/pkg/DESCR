eltclsh (editline tcl shell) is an interactive shell for the Tcl
programming language. It provides command line editing, history
browsing as well as variables and command completion thanks to
editline features. The completion engine is programmable in a way
similar to tcsh, and comes with an intelligent completion for the
full Tcl language by default.

The package also provides elwish, an interactive interpreter for the
Tk toolkit.
