This is version 2.0 of Guile, Project GNU's extension language library.
Guile is an implementation of the Scheme programming language, packaged
as a library that can be linked into applications to give them their own
extension language.  Guile supports other languages as well, giving
users of Guile-based applications a choice of languages.
