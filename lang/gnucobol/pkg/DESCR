GnuCOBOL is a free COBOL compiler, formerly known as OpenCOBOL.

It implements a substantial part of the COBOL 85, COBOL 2002 and COBOL 2014
standards, as well as many extensions included in other COBOL compilers.

GnuCOBOL translates COBOL into C and compiles the translated code using the
native C compiler.
