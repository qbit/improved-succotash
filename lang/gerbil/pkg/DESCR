Gerbil is an opinionated dialect of Scheme designed for Systems
Programming, with a state of the art macro and module system on top of
the Gambit runtime.

The macro system is based on quote-syntax, and provides the full
meta-syntactic tower with a native implementation of syntax-case. It
also provides a full-blown module system, similar to PLT Scheme's
(sorry, Racket) modules. The main difference from Racket is that
Gerbil modules are single instantiation, supporting high performance
ahead of time compilation and compiled macros.
