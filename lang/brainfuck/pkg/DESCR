Brainfuck is a programming language created in 1993 by Urban Muller and
notable for its extreme minimalism.

Brainfuck programs are composed as a series of characters. The language
specification defines eight characters/commands and four areas of
memory: code, code pointer, memory, and data pointer.

Although the language is Turing complete, the prohibitively long execution
time makes brainfuck programs impractical.
