Enchant is the PHP binding for the Enchant library. Enchant steps in
to provide uniformity and conformity on top of all spelling libraries,
and implement certain features that may be lacking in any individual
provider library.

Note that this requires loading shared library modules at runtime and
is not compatible with a default chroot configuration unless files are
copied in to the chroot jail.
