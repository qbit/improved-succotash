PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language. It can be embedded
in HTML documents and is frequently used as a server-side language for
web development but can also be used for command-line scripts.

It is cross-platform and has various front-ends ("SAPIs") that can be
used in conjunction with many web servers.

This main package includes the most common SAPIs: cli (the stand-alone
binary which can be used for command-line scripts) and fpm (the "FastCGI
process manager" which manages a pool of separate processes that accept
web-server requests over the FastCGI protocol).

Other SAPIs are packaged separately: php-cgi ("old style" CGI binary),
php-dbg (debugger), php-apache (an Apache 2 module).

Many language extensions are available - the most common are included
directly in the main packages, but others (usually requiring additional
dependencies) are packaged separately, notably those adding database
connectivity.
