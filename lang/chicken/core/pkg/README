| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Chicken Scheme will use better warnings when it has access to module database.
You can generate the database by running `chicken-install -update-db'.

There are also a lot of extensions called 'eggs' available for your use.
You can list and install eggs using the 'chicken-install' command.

Due to binary name conflicts the csc and csi binaries have been
renamed to chicken-csc and chicken-csi.
