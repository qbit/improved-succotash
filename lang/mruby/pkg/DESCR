mruby is the lightweight implementation of the Ruby language complying to (part
of) the ISO standard. Its syntax is Ruby 1.9 compatible.

mruby can be linked and embedded within your application. We provide the
interpreter program "mruby" and the interactive mruby shell "mirb" as examples.
You can also compile Ruby programs into compiled byte code using the mruby
compiler "mrbc".
