Starting MATE from xenodm
=========================
In order to start MATE as your desktop environment when logging in
xenodm, your ~/.xsession file should end with 

    exec ${LOCALBASE}/bin/ck-launch-session ${LOCALBASE}/bin/mate-session

Power management support
========================
MATE environment needs a system-wide D-Bus daemon ("messagebus")
to be running in order to work properly.

To enable "messagebus" at boot:
# rcctl enable messagebus

And to start it if not already running:
# rcctl start messagebus
