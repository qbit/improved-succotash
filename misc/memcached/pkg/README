From the upstream documentation, "Memcached does not spend much, if any,
effort in ensuring its defensibility from random internet connections.
So you must not expose memcached directly to the internet, or otherwise
any untrusted users. Using SASL authentication here helps, but should
not be totally trusted."

The default setting in this package is now to listen on localhost only.
If you need it to listen on the network, change the flags, and make sure
that the memcached port (default 11211) is firewalled.

# rcctl set memcached flags '-u _memcached'

To change to listening on a unix socket (local machine only) and allowing
access only from members of group _memcached:

# rcctl set memcached flags '-u _memcached -s /var/run/memcached/sock -a 0660'
