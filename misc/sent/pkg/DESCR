sent is a simple plaintext presentation tool.

sent does not need latex, libreoffice or any other fancy file format, it uses
plaintext files and png images. Every paragraph represents a slide in the
presentation.

The presentation is displayed in a simple X11 window. The content of each slide
is automatically scaled to fit the window and centered so you also don't have to
worry about alignment. Instead you can really concentrate on the content.
