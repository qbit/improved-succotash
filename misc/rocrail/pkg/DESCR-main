Rocrail can control a model train layout from one or more computers. You
can run trains directly from your computer, and you can have the
computer run trains automatically for you. You can even have some of the
trains on your layout running automatically while you control others by
hand.  Rocrail is two programs; the Rocrail Server and the Rocview
Client. These programs work with each other using Internet protocols,
and do not need to be on the same computer. You can use Rocrail from a
single computer connected directly to your layout, and you can also
control your layout from any computer on your home network, or over the
Internet. Rocrail also has a web interface, which will let you run the
layout from a web browser.
