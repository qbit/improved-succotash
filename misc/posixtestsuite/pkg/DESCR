The Open POSIX Test Suite is a test suite for POSIX 2001 APIs, not
tied to specific implementations.  It provides conformance, functional,
and stress testing.  Initial focus is on Threads, Clocks & Timers,
Signals, Message Queues, and Semaphores.

To run POSIX test suite on a regular basis as a OpenBSD regression
test, compile the software as a port.  All files needed to run the
tests are installed as package.  The port specific tool posixtestsuite
creates a run time environment, runs the tests, and stores the
results in the current directory.
