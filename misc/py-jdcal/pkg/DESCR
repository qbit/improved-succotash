This module contains functions for converting between Julian dates and
calendar dates.

A function for converting Gregorian calendar dates to Julian dates,
and another function for converting Julian calendar dates to Julian
dates are defined. Two functions for the reverse calculations are also
defined.

Different regions of the world switched to Gregorian calendar from
Julian calendar on different dates. Having separate functions for Julian
and Gregorian calendars allow maximum flexibility in choosing the
relevant calendar.
