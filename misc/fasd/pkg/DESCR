Fasd is a tool for quick access to files for POSIX shells. Fasd keeps
track of files you have accessed, so that you can quickly reference
them in the command line.

The name fasd comes from the default suggested aliases f(files),
a(files/directories), s(show/search/select), d(directories).

Fasd ranks files and directories by "frecency," that is, by both
"frequency" and "recency."
