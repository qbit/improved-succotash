reprepro is a tool to manage a repository of Debian packages.

It stores files either being injected manually or downloaded from some other
repository (partially) mirrored into one pool/ hierarchy.

Managed packages and files are stored in a Berkeley DB, so no database server
is needed.

Checking signatures of mirrored repositories and creating signatures of the
generated Package indices is supported.
