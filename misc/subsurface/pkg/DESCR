Subsurface can plan and track single- and multi-tank dives using
air, Nitrox or TriMix. It allows tracking of dive locations
including GPS coordinates (which can also conveniently be entered
using a map interface), logging of equipment used and names of other
divers, and lets users rate dives and provide additional notes.
