blink(1) is a super status light: it packs three dimensions of information
(color, brightness and pattern) into a single tiny package that fits into any
USB port on nearly every device. It makes it incredibly easy to connect any data
source in the cloud or on your computer to a full-color RGB LED so you can know
what's happening without checking any windows, going to any websites or typing
any commands.
