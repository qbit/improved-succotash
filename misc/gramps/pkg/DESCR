Gramps helps you track your family tree. It allows you to store, edit,
and research genealogical data with your computer. Gramps attempts to
provide all of the common capabilities of other genealogical programs,
but, more importantly, to provide an additional capability of
integration not common to these programs. This is the ability to input
any bits and pieces of information directly into Gramps and
rearrange/manipulate any/all data events in the entire data base (in any
order or sequence) to assist the user in doing research, analysis and
correlation with the potential of filling relationship gaps.
