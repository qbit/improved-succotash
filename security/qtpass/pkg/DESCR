QtPass is a GUI for pass, the standard unix password manager.

Password management should be simple and follow the Unix philosophy.
With pass, each password lives inside of a gpg encrypted file whose
filename is the title of the website or resource that requires the
password.

QtPass is a GUI client which allows easy restructuring of your
password-store. It can also sit in the system tray, so your passwords
are right at hand when you need them.
