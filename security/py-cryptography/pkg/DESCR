primitives, with the goal of it being a "cryptographic standard library".
It aims to address various problems seen with other Python cryptography
libraries, including lack of PyPy and Python 3 support, lack of maintenance.
use of poor implementations of algorithms, lack of high-level APIs, absence
of important algorithms, error prone APIs and bad defaults.
