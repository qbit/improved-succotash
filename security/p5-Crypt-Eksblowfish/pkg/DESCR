Eksblowfish is a variant of the Blowfish cipher, modified to make
the key setup very expensive. ("Eks" stands for "expensive key
schedule".) This doesn't make it significantly cryptographically
stronger, but is intended to hinder brute-force attacks.  It also
makes it unsuitable for any application requiring key agility.
