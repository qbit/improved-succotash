ZKT (Zone Key Tool) manages keys and signatures for DNSSEC-zones.
It consists of four commands:

zkt-conf, to manage the config file
zkt-ls, to list dnssec zone keys
zkt-keyman, to manage dnssec zone keys manually (seldom used)
zkt-signer, to sign a zone and manage the lifetime and rollover of the
zone signing keys

Most of the commands are simple wrapper commands around BIND's
dnssec-keygen(8) and dnssec-signzone(8) commands.

Warning: ZKT is old and doesn't seem to be very actively maintained -
it might not work with current versions of BIND tools. Users looking
to setup DNSSEC should look elsewhere, either higher-level tools like
opendnssec or the built-in support in PowerDNS authoritative server, or
using lower-level tools directly (dnssec-signzone from the isc-bind
package or ldns-signzone from the ldns-utils package).
