Fierce is a semi-lightweight scanner that helps locate non-contiguous IP
space and hostnames against specified domains. It's really meant as a
pre-cursor to nmap, unicornscan, nessus, nikto, etc, since all of those
require that you already know what IP space you are looking for. This
does not perform exploitation and does not scan the whole internet
indiscriminately. It is meant specifically to locate likely targets both
inside and outside a corporate network.
