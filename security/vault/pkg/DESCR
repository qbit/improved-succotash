Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you
want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates,
and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing
tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database credentials,
API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture
communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets is already very
difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and
detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is
where Vault steps in.
