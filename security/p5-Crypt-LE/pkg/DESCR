The Crypt::LE module provides the functionality necessary to use Let's
Encrypt API and generate free SSL certificates for your domains. It can
also be used to generate private RSA and ECC keys or Certificate Signing
Requests without resorting to openssl command line. Crypt::LE is shipped
with a self-sufficient client for obtaining SSL certificates, le.pl.

Both ACME v1 and ACME v2 protocols and wildcard certificate issuance are
supported.
