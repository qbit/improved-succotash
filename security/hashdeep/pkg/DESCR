hashdeep is a set of cross-platform tools to compute hashes, or message
digests, for any number of files while optionally recursively digging through
the directory structure. It can also take a list of known hashes and display
the filenames of input files whose hashes either do or do not match any of the
known hashes. This version supports MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, Tiger, and Whirlpool
hashes.
