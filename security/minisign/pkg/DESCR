Minisign is a dead simple tool to sign files and verify signatures.

It is portable, lightweight, and uses the highly secure Ed25519 public-key
signature system.

Signatures written by minisign can be verified using OpenBSD's signify tool:
public key files and signature files are compatible. However, minisign uses
a slightly different format to store secret keys.

Minisign signatures include trusted comments in addition to untrusted
comments. Trusted comments are signed, thus verified, before being
displayed. This adds two lines to the signature files, that signify
silently ignores.
