PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level cryptographic
primitives. It is an cleaned and simplified fork of PyCrypto, exposing
almost the same API. Most applications run unmodified, apart from a very
few compatibility breaks for those parts of the API that represented a
security hazard or that were too hard to maintain.

PyCryptodome is not a wrapper to a separate C library like OpenSSL.
To the largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure Python.
Only the pieces that are extremely critical to performance (e.g. block
ciphers) are implemented as C extensions.

As well as functionality supported by PyCrypto, this adds support for:

- Authenticated encryption modes (GCM, CCM, EAX, SIV, OCB)
- Elliptic curves cryptography (NIST P-256 curve only)
- SHA-3 (including SHAKE XOFs), SHA-512/t and BLAKE2 hash algorithms
- Salsa20 and ChaCha20 stream ciphers
- scrypt and HKDF
- Deterministic (EC)DSA
