The OATH Toolkit makes it easy to build one-time password authentication
systems. This package contains a shared library and a command line tool
for generating and validating OTPs.

Supported technologies include the event-based HOTP algorithm (RFC 4226)
and the time-based TOTP algorithm (draft-mraihi-totp-timebased-07).
OATH stands for Open AuTHentication, which is the organization that
specify the algorithms.

The OATH Toolkit also includes a library and tool for the Portable Symmetric
Key Container (PSKC) data format specified in RFC 6030 for dealing with
key provisioning; these are packaged separately to reduce dependencies
for users only requiring OTP.
