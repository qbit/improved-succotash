uacme is a lightweight client for the RFC8555 ACMEv2 protocol used with
certificate authorities to validate and issue X509 certificates. It is
written in plain C with minimal dependencies (libcurl and a TLS library)
and can handle all authentication types via external hooks (examples
included for http-01, dns-01 via nsupdate, and tls-alpn-01).
