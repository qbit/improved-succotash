plaso is a Python-based framework for computer forensic analysis. It can read
files from many types of filesystem and volume image, has parsers for a huge
number of file types across multiple platforms, and tools to deal with this
information, in particular log2timeline which can use this to produce a single
correlated timeline from a system.
