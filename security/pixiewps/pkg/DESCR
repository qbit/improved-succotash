Pixiewps is a tool written in C used to bruteforce offline the WPS PIN
exploiting the low or non-existing entropy of some software
implementations, the so-called "pixie-dust attack" discovered by
Dominique Bongard in summer 2014. It is meant for educational purposes
only.

As opposed to the traditional online brute-force attack, implemented in
tools like Reaver or Bully which aim to recover the pin in a few hours,
this method can get the PIN in only a matter of seconds or minutes,
depending on the target, if vulnerable.
