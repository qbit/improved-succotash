Pwntools is a CTF framework and exploit development library. Written in
Python, it is designed for rapid prototyping and development, and
intended to make exploit writing as simple as possible.

NB: Only the 'pwn' script has been installed, all other end-user scripts
are available through 'pwn', e.g. 'pwn checksec'.
