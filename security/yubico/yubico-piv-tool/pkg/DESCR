This package provides a tool and library for interacting with the PIV
("Personal Identity Verification") application on some YubiKey devices.
This application provides the public key functionality.

The tool allows you to generate keys on the device, import keys and
certificates, create certificate requests, and perform other operations.

See https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/ for more information.
