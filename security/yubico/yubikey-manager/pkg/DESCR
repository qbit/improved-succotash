The YubiKey Manager can configure FIDO2, OTP and PIV functionality on
a YubiKey. It works with any currently supported YubiKey. You can also
use the tool to check the type and firmware of a YubiKey. In addition,
you can use the extended settings to specify other features, such as to
configure 3-second long touch.
