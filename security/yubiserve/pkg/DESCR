yubikeyedup is a lightweight validation server for Yubikey OTP
authentication written in Python. It provides the standard HTTP-based
Validation Protocol 2.0 used by various servers including Yubico's
official PHP-based server.

It is a complete rewrite of the earlier project "YubiServe" (seemingly
abandoned and never ported to Python 3). It uses the same database schema
and is broadly compatible, though does not support HTTPS internally (if
wanted, this can be added by proxying from relayd, nginx or similar).
