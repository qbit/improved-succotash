KeePassXC is a community fork of KeePassX, the cross-platform port of KeePass
for Windows. Every feature works cross-platform and was thoroughly tested on
multiple systems to provide users with the same look and feel on every
supported operating system. This includes the beloved Auto-Type feature.

The complete database is always encrypted with the industry-standard AES (alias
Rijndael) encryption algorithm using a 256 bit key. KeePassXC uses a database
format that is compatible with KeePass Password Safe. Your wallet works offline
and requires no Internet connection.

Main Features:

- Secure storage of passwords and other private data with AES, Twofish or
  ChaCha20 encryption
- File format compatibility with KeePass2, KeePassX, MacPass, KeeWeb and many
  others (KDBX 3.1 and 4.0)
- SSH Agent integration
- Auto-Type on all supported platforms for automagically filling in login forms
- Key file and YubiKey challenge-response support for additional security
- TOTP generation (including Steam Guard)
- CSV import from other password managers (e.g., LastPass)
- Command line interface
- Stand-alone password and passphrase generator
- Password strength meter
- Database merge functionality
- Automatic reload when the database was changed externally
