PC/SC represents an abstraction layer to smart card readers. It provides
a communication layer with a wide variety of smart card readers through
a standardized API.

This PCSC perl module implements the Chipcard::PCSC class. Objects of
this class are used to communicate with the PCSC-lite daemon (see pcscd(1)
for more information).

A PCSC object can be used to communicate with more than one reader
through Chipcard::PCSC::Card objects. Please read Chipcard::PCSC::Card
for extended information on how to talk to a smart card reader.
