Fast elliptic curve cryptography, specifically digital signatures.  There
is no nonce reuse, no branching on secret material, and all points are
validated before any operations are performed on them.  Timing side
channels are mitigated via Montgomery point multiplication.  Nonces are
generated per RFC6979.
