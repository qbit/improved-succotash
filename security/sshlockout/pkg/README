syslogd(8) children run under the _syslogd user, but sshlockout(8)
should be run as root in order to modify its pf(4) table.  doas(1) can
be used to gain back root privileges:

  permit nopass _syslogd as root cmd ${TRUEPREFIX}/sbin/sshlockout


When using doas, the following line is required in /etc/syslog.conf:

  auth.info;authpriv.info | exec /usr/bin/doas -n ${TRUEPREFIX}/sbin/sshlockout -pf lockout


A rule must be added to /etc/pf.conf in order to block addresses within the
default lockout table:

  table <lockout> persist
  block in quick on egress proto tcp from <lockout> to port ssh
