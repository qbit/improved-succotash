The goal of cvechecker is to report about possible vulnerabilities on
your system, by scanning the installed software and matching the results
with the CVE database. Indeed, this is not a bullet-proof method and you
will most likely have many false positives (vulnerability is fixed with
a revision-release, but the tool isn't able to detect the revision
itself), yet it is still better than nothing, especially if you are
running a distribution with little security coverage.
