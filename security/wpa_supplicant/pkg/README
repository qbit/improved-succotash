Note for users familiar with wpa_supplicant on other OS
=======================================================
On OpenBSD, scanning and joining wireless networks is controlled by the
kernel and configured by ifconfig(8) commands or /etc/hostname.if, so
configuration is a little different than you may be used to.

Use of wpa_supplicant on OpenBSD
================================
wpa_supplicant is used for authentication on wired networks using 802.1x
and for wireless networks using WPA-Enterprise.

On OpenBSD, wpa_supplicant is *not* used for the more common WPA-PSK
wireless networks. These only need to be configured according to the
"IEEE 802.11 (WIRELESS DEVICES)" section in ifconfig(8) and the manual
page for your wireless interface - iwm(4), iwn(4), etc - i.e. by using
ifconfig(8) commands or hostname.if(5) files.

Configuring networks in wpa_supplicant.conf
-------------------------------------------
Add your network login information to wpa_supplicant's configuration in
${SYSCONFDIR}/wpa_supplicant.conf - either uncomment and edit the supplied example
or consult wpa_supplicant documentation or sample configuration from your
network operator. (In the case of distributed networks like Eduroam, this
would be from your home institution rather than the local network that
you're connecting to).

Do not enable "ap_scan" - it is not supported by the OpenBSD support code.

Configuring wireless interfaces for use with WPA-Enterprise
-----------------------------------------------------------
For most convenient use, the kernel can be configured to automatically join
the "best" network from a preconfigured list (it calculates a score based
on factors including signal strength and security options). This is done
using ifconfig's "join" command - e.g. to add a network "Laakista Humppa"
using WPA-Enterprise you could use

# ifconfig iwm0 join "Laakista Humppa" wpa wpaakms 802.1x

Or to configure from boot, add to /etc/hostname.iwm0 - as you would expect
this may be combined with WPA-PSK networks:

# cat /etc/hostname.iwm0
join "Laakista Humppa" wpa wpaakms 802.1x
join "Perjantaina Humpassa" wpa wpakey fridayfriday
join Lumpiohumppa wpa wpaprotos wpa1,wpa2 wpakey whatsecurity
inet6 autoconf
dhcp

If you would like to avoid "join" and connect to a single network only,
you would instead use "nwid", for example:

# ifconfig iwm0 nwid humppa wpa wpaakms 802.1x up

or to do this and also lock to a specific BSSID:

# ifconfig iwm0 nwid humppa bssid 11:22:33:44:55:66 wpa wpaakms 802.1x up

Starting wpa_supplicant
-----------------------
After configuring as above, enable wpa_supplicant via rcctl(8) -
"rcctl enable wpa_supplicant" as usual. It will attempt to auto detect
the interface name and type, but if there is a problem with this it can
be hardcoded instead. For a wireless network on iwm0:

# rcctl set wpa_supplicant flags -c ${SYSCONFDIR}/wpa_supplicant.conf -s -D openbsd -i iwm0

For a 802.1x wired network on ix0:

# rcctl set wpa_supplicant flags -c ${SYSCONFDIR}/wpa_supplicant.conf -s -D wired -i ix0

Then start as normal ("rcctl start wpa_supplicant"). wpa_supplicant should
automatically authenticate when it notices that the connection is up.
