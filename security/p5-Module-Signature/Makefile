# Enable signature check by the module itself during make regress.
# Thus the regression test only works on an unpatched port as it
# verifies the signatures of the files in wrkdist directory.  The
# public keys for that are added to the key ring during make configure.
# This does not provide additional security as the keys are shipped
# together with the source.  It just ensures that the port works fine.
