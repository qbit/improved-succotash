Stegseek is a lightning fast steghide cracker that can be used to
extract hidden data from files. It is built as a fork of the original
steghide project and, as a result, it is thousands of times faster than
other crackers and can run through the entirety of rockyou.txt* in under
2 seconds.

Stegseek can also be used to extract steghide metadata without a
password, which can be used to test whether a file contains steghide
data.
