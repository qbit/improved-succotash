Argon2 is a secure password hashing algorithm. Is is designed to
have both a configurable runtime as well as memory consumption.

The current workhorses of password hashing are unquestionably bcrypt
and PBKDF2. And while they're still fine to use, the password
cracking community embraced new technologies like GPUs and ASICs
to crack passwords in a highly parallel fashion.

An effective measure against extreme parallelism proved making
computation of password hashes also memory hard.

Between 2012 and 2015, the password hashing competition took place
to find a new, secure, and future-proof password hashing algorithm.
The winner of this competition was announced as Argon2.
