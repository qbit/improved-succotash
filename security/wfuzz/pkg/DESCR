Wfuzz has been created to facilitate the task in web applications
assessments and it is based on a simple concept: it replaces any
reference to the FUZZ keyword by the value of a given payload.

A payload in Wfuzz is a source of data.

This simple concept allows any input to be injected in any field of an
HTTP request, allowing to perform complex web security attacks in
different web application components such as: parameters,
authentication, forms, directories/files, headers, etc.
