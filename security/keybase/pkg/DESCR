Command line client for Keybase.io

Keybase maps your identity to your public keys, and vice versa. It
lets you 'prove' ownership of things like github accounts, domains and
twitter accounts.

Once you have proven various identities, it is easier for people to
verify that you are actually who you say you are. This gives some
confidence when sending / receiving signed or encrypted messages!

Keybase also offers personal and team chat, git repos and a remote filesystem.
Everything is encrypted end-to-end and tied to your personal account.
