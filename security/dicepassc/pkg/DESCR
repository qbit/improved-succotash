dicepassc is a passphrase generator for OpenBSD based on Arnold Reinhold's
Diceware wordlist and the Electronic Frontier Foundation's wordlists.

It aims to be a reasonably secure implementation by using arc4random(3) to
generate random numbers, explicit_bzero(3) to clear sensitive memory, and
pledge(2) to restrict the process.
