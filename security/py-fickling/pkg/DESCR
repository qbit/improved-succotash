Fickling is a decompiler, static analyzer, and bytecode rewriter for
Python pickle object serializations.

Pickled Python objects are in fact bytecode that is interpreted by a
stack-based virtual machine built into Python called the "Pickle
Machine". Fickling can take pickled data streams and decompile them into
human-readable Python code that, when executed, will deserialize to the
original serialized object.
