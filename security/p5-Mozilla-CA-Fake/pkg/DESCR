Mozilla::CA provides a copy of Mozilla's bundle of Certificate Authority
certificates in a form that can be consumed by modules and libraries based
on OpenSSL.

This package is an alternative. It does *not* directly install the
Mozilla CA bundle, instead the provided library function (which just
provides the location of the PEM file) has been modified to reference
the system /etc/ssl/cert.pem file.
