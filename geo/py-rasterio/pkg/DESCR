Rasterio's goal is a raster data library, expressing GDAL's data model
using fewer non-idiomatic extension classes and more idiomatic Python
types and protocols, while performing as fast as GDAL's Python bindings.

Geographic information systems use GeoTIFF and other formats to organize
and store gridded raster datasets such as satellite imagery and terrain
models. Rasterio reads and writes these formats and provides a Python
API based on Numpy N-dimensional arrays and GeoJSON.
