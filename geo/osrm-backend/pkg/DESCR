OSRM is a high performance routing engine written in C++14 designed to run on
OpenStreetMap data.

The following services are available via HTTP API, C++ library interface and
NodeJs wrapper:

- Nearest - Snaps coordinates to the street network and returns the nearest
  matches
- Route - Finds the fastest route between coordinates
- Table - Computes the duration or distances of the fastest route between all
  pairs of supplied coordinates
- Match - Snaps noisy GPS traces to the road network in the most plausible way
- Trip - Solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using a greedy heuristic
- Tile - Generates Mapbox Vector Tiles with internal routing metadata
