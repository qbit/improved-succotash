This library provides a command-line-interface (CLI) and Python library
to make access to Planet's public Data API easy to use.

The Data API is a REST HTTP API interface to Planet's imagery archive.
The API supports the following tasks: quick-searching assets and viewing
thumbnails of imagery; filtering imagery by location, date, satellite
source, cloud cover, and many other attributes; and downloading imagery
and metadata in several formats.
