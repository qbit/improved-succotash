Web Interface
=============

The default configuration makes traccar UI listen on localhost only.
The recommended way to access the service from the outside world is to use a
reverse proxy with SSL enabled.

The following is an example using nginx as an SSL reverse proxy:

server {
	add_header Cache-Control no-cache;
	add_header x-frame-options SAMEORIGIN;
	add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
	add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";

	listen	443;
	listen	[::]:443;

	expires 31d;
	ssl On;
	ssl_certificate fullcert_nokey.pem;
	ssl_certificate_key privkey.pem;

	location / {
		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8082/;
		proxy_set_header Host $host;
		proxy_http_version 1.1;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
		proxy_buffering     off;
		proxy_connect_timeout 1d;
		proxy_send_timeout    1d;
		proxy_read_timeout    1d;
		proxy_redirect off;
		proxy_set_header Proxy "";
		proxy_cookie_path /api "/api; secure; HttpOnly";
	}
}

Open Network Ports
==================

By default, traccar will listen on many network ports. Each tracker protocol
requires its own open port. So you should really block those ports using pf and
only allow the protocols you actually use.

You can also restrict the open ports by altering the default.xml file and remove
all the protocols you don't use. However, the default.xml file will change on
almost every revision, so if you do that you should do it on a copy of
default.xml and reference that copy in traccar.xml configuration file. Also, you
should ensure that at every upgrade, you track the changes in default.xml as
the file contains important informations about SQL queries. This is definitely
more complex than firewalling the unused ports.
