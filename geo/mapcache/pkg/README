If you plan to use mapcache CGI with a chrooted web server, make sure to
copy the libs needed by mapcache binary from ${LOCALBASE}/lib. If you
copy them keeping the same directory hierarchy (with lib, local/lib and
X11R6/lib, you need to make sure there's a ld.so.hints file inside the
chroot pointing to those dirs. You can do all this with:
# mkdir -p /var/www/usr/{libexec,{,local,X11R6}/lib}
# ldd /var/www/cgi-bin/mapcache  | awk '/lib/ { print $7 }' | while read f ; do cp $f /var/www/$f ; done

You also need to ensure mapcache can write to its cache directory, /tmp
in the chroot by default:

# install -d -o www /var/www/tmp

If you would like to use FastCGI with nginx, use the provided rc.d(8)
script and add the following lines to your nginx.conf:

location /cgi-bin/mapcache {
	fastcgi_pass  unix:run/mapcache.sock;
	fastcgi_split_path_info ^(/cgi-bin/mapcache)(.*)$;
	fastcgi_param SCRIPT_NAME $fastcgi_script_name;
	fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
	include fastcgi_params;
}

You also need to set the path to the mapcache configuration file via a
login.conf class:

mapcache:\
	:setenv=MAPCACHE_CONFIG_FILE=conf/mapcache.xml:\
	:tc=daemon:

and then visit http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapcache/demo.
