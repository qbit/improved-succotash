Written in expect, it is designed to directly map an interactive
terminal session into an automation script.

expect-lite scripts use special character(s) at the beginning of
each line to indicate the action. Basic expect-lite scripts can be
created by simply cutting and pasting text from a terminal window
into a script, and adding '>' '<' characters.

No knowledge of expect is required!
