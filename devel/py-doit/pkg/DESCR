doit comes from the idea of bringing the power of build-tools to execute
any kind of task. A task describes some computation to be done
(actions), and contains some extra meta-data. doit uses the task's
meta-data to cache task results, correct execution order, and execute in
parallel. doit is self-documented, provides inotify integration, allows
for custom output, and is extensible.
