LDoc is a second-generation documentation tool that can be used as
a replacement for LuaDoc.

LDoc can provide integrated documentation with traditional function
comments, any documents in Markdown format, and specified source
examples. Lua source in examples and the documents will be prettified.

It is mostly compatible with LuaDoc, except that certain workarounds
are no longer needed.
