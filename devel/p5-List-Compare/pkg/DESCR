List::Compare is a Perl module which provides ways of comparing
two or more lists.

List::Compare provides an object-oriented interface which accepts Perl
arrays and hashes as arguments and returns data structures representing
comparisons such as intersection, union, complement, symmetric
difference, subset and so forth.

A functional interface is also available via List::Compare::Functional.
