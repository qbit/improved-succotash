libinotify uses kqueue(2) to monitor for changed files. This only works
up to the system's "open file descriptors" limit - if software using
libinotify needs to handle large directories, the kern.maxfiles
sysctl(8) should be increased by adding an entry in sysctl.conf(5) and
the user's login(1) class modified accordingly by bumping the "cur" and
"max" "openfiles" limit in login.conf(5).
