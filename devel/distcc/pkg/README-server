distccd
=======
distcc can run over TCP or SSH. For TCP connections the `distccd`
daemon has to be running on the remote hosts. Jobs will run by default
as the unprivileged `_distcc` user. In order to allow incoming
connections to a "worker", one has to modify distccd flags to
reflect the address/subnet of originating connections:

# rcctl enable distccd
# rcctl set distccd flags --allow 192.168.50.0/24
# rcctl start distccd
