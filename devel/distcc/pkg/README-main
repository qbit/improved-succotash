distcc
======
To spawn compilation jobs on remote hosts, a minimal configuration
such as the following can be used as `~/.distcc/hosts`:

    localhost 192.168.178.13

or `/etc/distcc/hosts` for a system-wide configuration.
For SSH connections prefix hosts with `@` in the host specification.
distcc will run the jobs as the user invoking distcc.

Then set `$CC` to `distcc` to distribute compilation jobs across the
configured nodes.

Masquerading
============
Since distcc 3.3 it is recommended to use whitelisted compiler binaries.
This feature is called masquerading and it's enabled by default. See
the MASQUERADING section in distcc(1) how to set this up.
If you wish to disable it and fallback to the old behaviour, use the
`--make-me-a-botnet` parameter for distccd.
