| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

On OpenBSD, the BuildBot package has an associated _buildbot user for
running the master.  The default master directory is expected to be
found in ${HOMEDIR}.  Before being run for the first time, the
master directory must be initialized.  This is done as follows:

    # su -m _buildbot -c "buildbot create-master ${HOMEDIR}"

The next step is to create a ${HOMEDIR}/master.cfg configuration
file that fits your needs.  Please refer to the BuildBot documentation
on how to do so. 


Databases
=========
BuildBot supports number of different databases (via SQLAlchemy), but
you need to install Python database adapter(s) to use them:
* py-mysql - for MySQL database, 
* py-psycopg2 - for PostgreSQL database.

SQLite works out-of-the-box.


Upgrading
=========
If you're upgrading SQLite-based BuildBot from older release, you must
migrate its database before the first run using following command:

    # su -m _buildbot -c "buildbot upgrade-master ${HOMEDIR}"

If you're using BuildBot with either MySQL or PostgreSQL database, you
must also pass the connection string:

    # su -m _buildbot -c "buildbot upgrade-master \
           --db=postgresql://buildbot:<password>@localhost/buildbot ${HOMEDIR}"
