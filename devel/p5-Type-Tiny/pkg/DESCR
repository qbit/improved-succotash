Type::Tiny is a small class for writing type constraints, inspired by
Moose's type constraint API. It has only one non-core dependency (and
even that is simply a module that was previously distributed as part of
Type::Tiny but has since been spun off), and can be used with Moose,
Mouse and Moo (or none of the above).
