Font issues in the output window
================================

After hitting the Clean & Build or the Run buttons from
within the IDE, the output window will show square boxes
instead of fonts.

Bug 145696 was filed but marked as WONTFIX by NetBeans developers:
	https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=145696

Native Libraries
================

The profiler module is not included in the port. Additionally,
the following modules, although included, contain native code which
will likely not work:
- cnd
- dlight
