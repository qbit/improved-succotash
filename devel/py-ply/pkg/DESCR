PLY is an implementation of the lex and yacc parsing tools written
entirely in Python. It uses LR-parsing which is reasonably efficient and
well suited for larger grammars.

PLY provides most of the standard lex/yacc features including support
for empty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support for
ambiguous grammars.
