This module allows you to build a variable package that contains a
package template and can use it to build variant packages at runtime.

Your variable package will export a subroutine which will build a
variant package, combining its arguments with the template, and
return the name of the new variant package.

The implementation does not care about what kind of packages it
builds, be they simple function exporters, classes, singletons or
something entirely different.
