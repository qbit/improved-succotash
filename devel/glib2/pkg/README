File and directory monitor
==========================
GLib (GFileMonitor) provides realtime kqueue(2) notifications and
monitoring up to the open file descriptors limit.
If gio-kqueue needs to handle large directories, the kern.maxfiles
sysctl(8) should be increased by adding an entry in sysctl.conf(5) and
the user's login(1) class modified accordingly by bumping the "cur" and
"max" openfiles limit in login.conf(5).
