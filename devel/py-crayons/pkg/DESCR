This module is really simple, it gives you colored strings for terminal usage.
Included colors are red, green, yellow, blue, black, magenta, cyan, white,
and normal (as well as clean and disable).

Crayons is nice because it automatically wraps a given string in both the
foreground color, as well as returning to the original state after the string
is complete. Most terminal color libraries make you manage this yourself.
