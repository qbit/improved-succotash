Exception::Class::TryCatch provides syntactic sugar for use with
Exception::Class using the familiar keywords try and catch. Its
primary objective is to allow users to avoid dealing directly with
$@ by ensuring that any exceptions caught in an eval are captured
as Exception::Class objects, whether they were thrown objects to
begin with or whether the error resulted from die. This means that
users may immediately use isa and various Exception::Class methods
to process the exception.
