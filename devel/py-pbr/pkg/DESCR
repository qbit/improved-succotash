A library for managing setuptools packaging needs in a consistent manner.
pbr reads and then filters the setup.cfg data through a setup hook to
fill in default values and provide more sensible behaviors, and then
feeds the results in as the arguments to a call to setup.py - so the
heavy lifting of handling Python packaging needs is still being done by
setuptools.

pbr can and does do a bunch of things for you:

- Version: Manage version number based on git revisions and tags
- AUTHORS: Generate AUTHORS file from git log
- ChangeLog: Generate ChangeLog from git log
- Manifest: Generate a sensible manifest from git files and some standard files
- Release Notes: Generate a release notes file using reno
- Requirements: Store your dependencies in a pip requirements file
- long_description: Use your README file as a long_description
- Smart find_packages: Smartly find packages under your root package
- Sphinx Autodoc: Generate autodoc stub files for your whole module
