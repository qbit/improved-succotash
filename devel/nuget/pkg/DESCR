NuGet is the package manager for .NET. The NuGet client tools provide the
ability to produce and consume packages. The NuGet Gallery is the central
package repository used by all package authors and consumers.

For .NET (including .NET Core), the Microsoft-supported mechanism for sharing
code is NuGet, which defines how packages for .NET are created, hosted, and
consumed, and provides the tools for each of those roles.

Put simply, a NuGet package is a single ZIP file with the .nupkg extension that
contains compiled code (DLLs), other files related to that code, and a
descriptive manifest that includes information like the package's version
number. Developers with code to share create packages and publish them to a
public or private host. Package consumers obtain those packages from suitable
hosts, add them to their projects, and then call a package's functionality in
their project code. NuGet itself then handles all of the intermediate details.
