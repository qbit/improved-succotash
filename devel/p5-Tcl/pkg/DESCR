The Tcl extension provides a small but complete interface into libtcl
and any other Tcl-based library. It lets you create Tcl interpreters
(as perl5 objects), bind in commands to them (either perl subroutines
or C functions dynamically loaded with the DynaLoader extension) and
execute Tcl code in those interpreters.
