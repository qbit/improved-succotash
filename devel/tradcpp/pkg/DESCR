tradcpp is a K&R-style ("traditional") C preprocessor. It was written to
support historical uses of the C preprocessor for preprocessing things that
aren't C, as the preprocessors that ship with C compilers are increasingly
unsuitable for this task and/or don't provide a traditional mode at all.

In particular, tradcpp preserves whitespace as much as possible, so it can be
used in contexts where whitespace is significant and/or rearranging whitespace
causes things to break, such as makefiles. Preprocessing makefiles with cpp is
a fairly common property of sufficiently old legacy build systems, including
old versions of Emacs and anything that uses imake.
