Fixtures defines a Python contract for reusable state / support
logic, primarily for unit testing. Helper and adaptation logic is
included to make it easy to write your own fixtures using the
fixtures contract. Glue code is provided that makes using fixtures
that meet the Fixtures contract in unittest compatible test cases
easy and straightforward.
