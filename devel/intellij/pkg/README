Windowing Problems
==================
If the splash-screen displays but you then only see a grey main screen,
install the wmname package and run 'wmname LG3D'. This is a problem that
has been seen with some Java-based applications used with a non-reparenting
window manager (e.g. cwm).

Native Libraries
================
Functionality depending on native libraries is not likely to work.

Errors After Upgrading
======================
If you receive errors starting after an upgrade, try the following:

1. Remove the ${HOME}/.IdeaICXXXX.Y/config/plugins directory
2. Remove the following directories
  a. ${HOME}/.local/share/JetBrains
  b. ${HOME}/.cache/JetBrains
  c. ${HOME}/.config/JetBrains
3. Relaunch intellij
4. Reinstall the removed plugins
