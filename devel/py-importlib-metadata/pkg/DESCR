importlib_metadata is a library which provides an API for accessing an
installed packages metadata (see PEP 566), such as its entry points or
its top-level name. This functionality intends to replace most uses of
pkg_resources entry point API and metadata API. Along with
importlib.resources in Python 3.7 and newer (backported as
importlib_resources for older versions of Python), this can eliminate
the need to use the older and less efficient pkg_resources package.
