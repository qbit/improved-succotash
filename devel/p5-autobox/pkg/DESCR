The autobox pragma allows methods to be called on integers, floats,
strings, arrays, hashes, and code references in exactly the same manner
as blessed references.
The autoboxing is transparent: boxed values are not blessed into their
(user-defined) implementation class (unless the method elects to bestow
such a blessing) - they simply use its methods as though they are.
