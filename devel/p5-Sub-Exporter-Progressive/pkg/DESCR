Sub::Exporter is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power
comes great responsibility, er- as well as some runtime penalties. This
module is a Sub::Exporter wrapper that will let your users just use
Exporter if all they are doing is picking exports, but use Sub::Exporter
if your users try to use Sub::Exporter's more advanced features, like
renaming exports, if they try to use them.
