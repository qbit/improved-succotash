Provides a very clunky interface to access the Windows registry, and is
not currently being developed actively.  It only exists for backward
compatibility with old code that uses it.  For more powerful and
flexible ways to access the registry, use Win32::TieRegistry.

Dependencies for the GUI tools are not enforced.

To use the Gtk+ tools (gtkregcompare.pl, gtkregscope.pl, gtkregview.pl):
# pkg_add p5-Gtk2

To use the Wx tools (wxregcompare.pl, wxregscope.pl, wxregview.pl):
# pkg_add p5-Wx
