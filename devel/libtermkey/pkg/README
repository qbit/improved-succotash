libtermkey and tmux
===================

Both tmux and libtermkey wait after an escape is input to determine if it is
part of a function or meta key sequences.  This leads to false positives in
meta key sequence detection in programs that use libtermkey.  To work around
this bug one may reduce such delay in tmux to a value below the default 50 ms
value in libtermkey by setting "escape-time" setting in tmux configuration:

	set-option escape-time 40
