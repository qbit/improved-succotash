This module can be used to determine the mime type of a file. It tries
to implement the freedesktop specification for a shared MIME database.

It also provides two tools:

- mimetype: determine file types.
- mimeopen: open files by mimetype, similar to xdg-open(1)
            from xdg-utils, but with more options.
