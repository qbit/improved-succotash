YAPF is a formatter based off of 'clang-format'. In essence, the algorithm takes
the code and reformats it to the best formatting that conforms to the style
guide, even if the original code didn't violate the style guide. If the whole
codebase of a project is simply piped through YAPF whenever modifications are
made, the style remains consistent throughout the project and there's no point
arguing about style in every code review.
