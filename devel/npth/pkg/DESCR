nPth is a non-preemptive threads implementation using an API very similar to
the one known from GNU Pth. It has been designed as a replacement of GNU Pth
for non-ancient operating systems. In contrast to GNU Pth is is based on the
system's standard threads implementation. Thus nPth allows the use of
libraries which are not compatible to GNU Pth.
