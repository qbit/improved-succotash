CLI::Framework ("CLIF") provides a framework and conceptual pattern
for building full-featured command line applications. It intends
to make this process simple and consistent. It assumes the
responsibility of implementing details that are common to all
command-line applications, making it possible for new applications
adhering to well-defined conventions to be built without the need
to repeatedly write the same command-line interface code.
