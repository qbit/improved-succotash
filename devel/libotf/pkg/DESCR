The library "libotf" provides the following facilities:

- Read Open Type Layout Tables from OTF file.  Currently these
  tables are supported; head, name, cmap, GDEF, GSUB, and GPOS.

- Convert a Unicode character sequence to a glyph code sequence by
  using the above tables.

The combination of libotf and the FreeType library (Ver.2) realizes
CTL (complex text layout) by OpenType fonts.
