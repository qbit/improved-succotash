ANA is a project to provide easy distributed data storage for stuff. It
provides every object with a UUID and, when pickled, will first
serialize the object's state to a central location and then "pickle" the
object into just its UUID. This is really handy when you have to
distribute objects in some distributed system, and you'd rather not
pickle the whole object every time you need to send it.
