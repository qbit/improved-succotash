Data::Printer is a tool to display Perl variables and objects on screen.
Unlike Data::Dumper, which outputs a format suitable for use with eval,
Data::Printer's format is intended for human inspection.

- Human-friendly output, with array index and custom separators
- Full object dumps including methods, inheritance and internals
- Exposes extra information such as tainted data and weak references
- Ability to easily create filters for objects and regular structures
