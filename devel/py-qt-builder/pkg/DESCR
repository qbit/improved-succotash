PyQt-builder is the PEP 517 compliant build system for PyQt and projects
that extend PyQt. It extends the sip build system and uses Qt's qmake to
perform the actual compilation and installation of extension modules.

Projects that use PyQt-builder provide an appropriate pyproject.toml
file and an optional project.py script. Any PEP 517 compliant frontend,
for example sip-install or pip can then be used to build and install the
project.
