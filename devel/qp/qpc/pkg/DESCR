QP/C (Quantum Platform in C) is a lightweight, open source software
framework/RTOS for building reactive real-time embedded applications as
systems of cooperating, event-driven active objects (actors). The QP/C
framework is a member of a larger QP family consisting of QP/C, QP/C++, and
QP-nano frameworks, which are all strictly quality controlled, thoroughly
documented, and commercially licensable.
