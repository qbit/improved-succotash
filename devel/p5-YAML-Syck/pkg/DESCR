YAML::Syck is an optimized variation of YAML built on perl code
(libsyck). It also features a JSON::Syck module, with an interface
different to the pure-perl JSON module.

Note: this module has a lot of known issues and has only been semi-
actively maintained since 2007. See YAML::Syck(3p) for more information.
