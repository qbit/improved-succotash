The libgcroots library abstracts the architecture-dependent part of garbage
collector roots acquisition such as register windows of SPARC and register
stack backing store of IA-64. The main code is based on Boehm GC 7.0.

With this library, one can easily write a garbage collector with goals such
as a small footprint, some application-specific optimizations, learning, or
to test experimental ideas.
