This project can be used to generate C bindings for Rust code:

* Builds bindings for a crate, its mods, its dependent crates, and their mods
* Only the necessary types for exposed functions are given bindings
* Can specify annotations for controlling some aspects of binding
* Support for generic structs and unions
* Support for exporting constants and statics
* Customizable formatting, can be used in C or C++ projects
* Support for generating #ifdef's for #[cfg] attributes
* Support for #[repr(sized)] tagged enum's
