The Firm library implements the Firm intermediate representation (ir).

libFirm contains algorithms for construction of the SSA form directly
from the attributed syntax tree. A set of analyses and optimization
phases is provided.

libFirm includes backends of varying maturities for IA32, AMD64, ARM,
and other architectures.

Features:
* Completely graph-based, source- and target-independent intermediate
  representation in SSA form
* Extensive set of optimizations
* High-quality register allocation
