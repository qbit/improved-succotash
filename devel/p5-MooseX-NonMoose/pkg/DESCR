MooseX::NonMoose allows for easily subclassing non-Moose classes with
Moose, taking care of the annoying details connected with doing this,
such as setting up proper inheritance from Moose::Object and installing
(and inlining, at make_immutable time) a constructor that makes sure
things like BUILD methods are called.
