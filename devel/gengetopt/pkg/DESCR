gengetopt generates a C function that uses getopt_long function to parse
the command line options, to validate them and fill a struct.

gengetopt is perfect if you are too lazy to write all stuff required to
call getopt_long, and when you have a program and wish it took options.

Generated code works if you use GNU Autoconf or GNU Automake.
