Traitlets is a framework that lets Python classes have attributes with
type checking, dynamically calculated default values, and 'on change'
callbacks.

The package also includes a mechanism to use traitlets for
configuration, loading values from files or from command line arguments.
This is a distinct layer on top of traitlets, so you can use traitlets
in your code without using the configuration machinery.
