FlatBuffers is an efficient cross platform serialization library for
C++, C#, C, Go, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, Lobster, Lua, TypeScript,
PHP, Python, Rust and Swift. It was originally created at Google for
game development and other performance-critical applications.

What sets FlatBuffers apart is that it represents hierarchical data in
a flat binary buffer in such a way that it can still be accessed
directly without parsing/unpacking, while also still supporting data
structure evolution (forwards/backwards compatibility).
