# Test::Simple 1.001014 is included in base Perl 5.24.3.  The test in Sub::Info
# needs Test2::Tools::Tiny which is included in newer Test::Simple.  Updating
# modules in base Perl or having newer ports as additional module version has
# its drawbacks.  Just leave p5-Sub-Info without working test for now.
