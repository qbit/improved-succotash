Small library that offers basic data structures (list, set, map, ..)
in a pure C API for user-space applications. Key features:

- Easy to use, portable
- No "magic" MACROs, and no need to modify your data structures (except,
perhaps, for __attribute__((packed)))
- Uses C++ standard library as the backend for most data structures
- Reasonable performance
