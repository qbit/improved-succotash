PlugnPLay (PnP) is a generic plug-in system inspired by Trac's internal
component management. With PnP you can turn any program into a pluggable
software very easily. You just have to define the Interfaces and let others
implement them. When your code is running you can dynamically retrieve who are
the classes that implement a certain Interface, and call the specific methods.
