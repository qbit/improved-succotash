A singleton is a class that has only one instance in an application.
MooseX::Singleton lets you easily upgrade (or downgrade, as it were)
your Moose class to a singleton.

All you should need to do to transform your class is to change use Moose
to use MooseX::Singleton. This module uses metaclass roles to do its
magic, so it should cooperate with most other MooseX modules.
