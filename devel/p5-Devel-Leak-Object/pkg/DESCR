This module provides tracking of objects, for the purpose of detecting
memory leaks due to circular references or innappropriate caching
schemes.

Object tracking can be enabled on a per object basis. Any objects
thus tracked are remembered until DESTROYed; details of any objects
left are printed out to STDERR at END-time.

Of particular interest is 
use Devel::Leak::Object qw{ GLOBAL_bless };

which overrides CORE::bless to give a full tally of all objects at END {}
