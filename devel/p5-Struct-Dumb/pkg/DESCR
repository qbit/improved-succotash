Struct::Dumb creates record-like structure types,
similar to the struct keyword in C, C++ or C#,
or Record in Pascal.
An invocation of this module will create a construction
function which returns new object references with the
given field values. These references all respond to
lvalue methods that access or modify the values stored.
