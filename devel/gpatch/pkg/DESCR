GNU patch is the Free Software Foundation's version of the patch(1)
command.

Patch takes a patch file containing a difference listing produced
by the diff program and applies those differences to one or more
original files, producing patched versions.

The patch binary is prefixed with the letter g to differentiate it
from the standard application with the same name.
