cvs-fast-export analyzes a collection of RCS files and, when possible,
emits an equivalent history in the form of a git fast-import stream.
Not all possible histories can be rendered this way; the program tries
to emit useful warnings when it can't.

A wrapper script called cvsconvert runs a conversion to git and
looks for content mismatches with the original CVS.

The analysis stage of this code originally travelled as "parsecvs" and
was written by Keith Packard in early 2006. It was briefly maintained by
Bart Massey before passing to Eric S. Raymond in late 2012.
