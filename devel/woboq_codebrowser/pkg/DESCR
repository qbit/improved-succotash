The generator generates static HTML pages that can be served by any web
server. It can be run automatically manually or with a hook on your
version control or CI system.

It functions as the source code indexer (using libclang). In contrast to
other solutions (LXR, OpenGrok) it semantically analyzes the code as a
compile step.

The generation is a two-step process: First is a compile step that
creates a .h.html and .cpp.html (and some other) files from the syntax
tree (AST) of the source source. The second step generates an index.html
for each directory.

A server-side database or CGI script are currently not needed, so it is
easy to host. Your normal HTML5 web browser is the source code navigator
(from your local machine or your network).
