BCUnit is a Unit testing framework for C. The basic framework is
platform/version independent and should be portable to all platforms. BCUnit
provides various interfaces to the framework, some of which are platform
dependent (e.g. curses on *nix). Building other interfaces should be
straightforward with the facilities provided in the framework.
