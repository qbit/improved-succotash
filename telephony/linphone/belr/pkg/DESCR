Belr is Belledonne Communications' language recognition library, written in
C++11. It parses text inputs formatted according to a language defined by an
ABNF grammar, such as the protocols standardized at IETF.

It drastically simplifies the writing of a parser, provided that the parsed
language is defined with an ABNF grammar. The parser automaton is automatically
generated by belr library, in memory, from the ABNF grammar text.  The
application developer is responsible to connect belr's parser with its custom
code through callbacks in order to get notified of recognized language
elements.
