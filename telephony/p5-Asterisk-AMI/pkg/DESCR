This module provides an interface to the Asterisk Manager Interface.
Its goal is to provide a flexible, powerful, and reliable way to
interact with Asterisk upon which other applications may be built.
It utilizes AnyEvent and therefore can integrate very easily into
event-based applications, but still provides blocking functions for use
with standard scripting.
