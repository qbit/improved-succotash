Configuration
=============
There are several different example configurations provided with this
packages:

${PREFIX}/share/examples/asterisk/default - Asterisk's standard sample
configuration files. These are undoubtedly useful as a reference,
but rather large, and awkward to use as a base for your own configuration.

${PREFIX}/share/examples/asterisk/basic-pbx - an Asterisk-provided example
of a basic pbx implementation for a fictitious company.

Asterisk logs to /var/log/asterisk/messages by default; log rotation
can be handled by adding a line like the following to /etc/newsyslog.conf:

/var/log/asterisk/messages		640  5     1000 *     Z "asterisk -rx 'logger reload'"
